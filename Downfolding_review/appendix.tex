\section*{Appendix}
In section~\ref{subsection:3band} we discussed parameterizing the transformation ${\bf T}$ 
as a $4\times12$ matrix for the $2 \times 2$ unit cell in terms of $\alpha_1$, $\alpha_2$, $\alpha_3$ 
and $\alpha_4$. Using the numbering of the orbitals corresponding to Fig.~\ref{fig:threeband}, 
the explicit form of ${\bf T}$ is,
\begin{eqnarray}
{\bf T} = 
\left(
\begin{array}{cccccccccccc}
F        & \alpha_2 &        \alpha_2 &  \alpha_4 & \alpha_1 & \alpha_1 & -\alpha_1 & -\alpha_1 & \alpha_3 & -\alpha_3 & \alpha_3 & -\alpha_3 \\
\alpha_2 &  F       &        \alpha_4 &  \alpha_2 & \alpha_3 & -\alpha_1 & \alpha_1 & -\alpha_3 & -\alpha_3 & \alpha_3 & \alpha_1 & -\alpha_1 \\
\alpha_2 & \alpha_4 & F               &  \alpha_2 & -\alpha_1 & \alpha_3 & -\alpha_3 & \alpha_1 & \alpha_1 & -\alpha_1 & -\alpha_3 & \alpha_3 \\
\alpha_4 & \alpha_2 & \alpha_2        &   F       & -\alpha_3 & -\alpha_3 & \alpha_3 & \alpha_3 & -\alpha_1 & \alpha_1 & -\alpha_1 & \alpha_1 \\
\end{array}
\right)\,,
\end{eqnarray}
where we have defined $F \equiv \sqrt{1-4{\alpha_1}^2 - 2{\alpha_2}^2 - 4 {\alpha_3}^2 -{\alpha_4}^2}$.

We now discuss a concrete and representative example of our results for the $2\times2$ cell 
for $U_d/t_{pd}=8$ and $\Delta/t_{pd}=3$. The first task was to obtain the optimal transformation ${\bf T}$ 
for which the lowest three eigenstates ($s=1,2,3$) of the three-band model were used for 
computing the cost in Eq.~\eqref{eq:C}. The minimum of the cost was 
determined by a brute force scan in the four dimensional space of $\alpha$'s and 
using a linear grid spacing of $0.002$ found $\alpha_1=0.216$, $\alpha_2=0.042$, $\alpha_3=0.018$ and $\alpha_4=0.016$. 
The two terms in the cost i.e. the trace and orthogonality conditions are individually satisfied to a relative error of 
less than 0.5 percent. 

We computed $\langle c_i^{\dagger} c_j \rangle_s$ and $\langle {c_{j,\uparrow}}^{\dagger} {c_{m,\downarrow}}^{\dagger} c_{n,\downarrow} c_{k,\uparrow} \rangle_{s}$ and hence obtain $\langle {\tilde{d}_{i,\eta}}^{\dagger} \tilde{d}_{j,\eta} \rangle_{s}$ 
and $\langle \tilde{n}_{i,\uparrow} \tilde{n}_{i,\downarrow} \rangle_{s}$ once the optimal ${\bf T}$ has been determined. 
As mentioned in the main text, the value of $\langle \tilde{d}_1^{\dagger} \tilde{d}_2 \rangle_s$ provides estimates for $U/t$ 
of the effective model by direct comparison of its value to that in the corresponding eigenstate in the one-band model. 
For our test example, the absolute values of $\langle \tilde{d}_1^{\dagger} \tilde{d}_2 \rangle_s$ 
in states $s=1,2,3$ are approximately $0.159$, $0.142$ and $0.084$ respectively which correspond to 
$(U/t)_1 \approx 14.1 $, $(U/t)_2 \approx 13.2 $, $(U/t)_3 \approx 12.7 $. Performing DMD with the three eigenergies and their 
calculated RDMs gave $t=0.3025$ eV and $U/t = 13.45 $; the latter in the correct range of the other estimates.
