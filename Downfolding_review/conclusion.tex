\section{Conclusion and Future prospects}



We have explained the DMD method that we have been developing, primarily in conjunction with the 
\textit{ab initio} QMC approach. The practical motivation is to take data from first principles (continuum) 
calculations as inputs for lattice model (discrete) methods. 
Since one is mapping a many-body problem to a few-body one, the relevant quantities of interest are 
the reduced density matrices associated with the many-body wave functions projected to a one-body space. 
The density matrix based approach is appealing as it is democratic in the determination of the hopping and interaction parts of the effective Hamiltonian, and provides multiple checks on its validity. 
We have discussed representative examples to present the conceptual and algorithmic aspects of DMD. 

The resultant lattice model can be efficiently and accurately solved for large system sizes~\cite{LeBlanc_PRX} using techniques designed and suited for small local Hilbert spaces; these include exact or selected diagonalization~\cite{DeRaedt,Tubman_selci,Holmes_Tubman_Umrigar}, density matrix renormalization group (DMRG)~\cite{White1992}, tensor networks~\cite{PEPS,Changlani_CPS,NeuscammanCPS}, dynamical mean field theory (DMFT)~\cite{Kotliar2006}, density matrix embedding (DMET)~\cite{DMET_2012} and lattice QMC methods~\cite{Scalapino, Trivedi_Ceperley, Zhang_AFQMC, Sandvik_loops, Prokofiev, 
Booth2009,SQMC,Holmes_Changlani_Umrigar, Booth2013}. 
These methods have also been used to obtain excited states, dynamical correlation functions and thermal properties, that have been difficult to obtain in \textit{ab initio} approaches. 


Finally we would like to emphasize that DMD, though conceptually simple, 
is still a method in its development stages, with room for algorithmic improvements and new applications. 
Advances in the field of inverse problems~\cite{Berg2017} could be incorporated into DMD to 
mitigate the problems associated with optimization and over-fitting. 
Here we briefly outline some aspects that need further research,
\begin{itemize} 
	\item Construction of wave function database:
	The DMD method relies crucially on the availability of a low energy space of \textit{ab-initio} wave functions, which despite not being eigenstates. Automating its construction remains challenging and requires knowledge of the 
	\item Optimal choice of basis functions. Ultimately, Intrinsic atomic orbitals (pointed out to us by G. K. Chan) which mitigate this issue. 
	\item Form of the low energy model Hamiltonian:
	Extensive work in the literature has been devoted to parameterizing compact effective Hamiltonians~\cite{Georges, Oles, Coury}. 
	Since the low energy effective Hamiltonian is not unique, there is not necessarily one right way of downfolding. 
	One could catalogue all functional forms based on previous parameterizations 
	or there may be some merit in determining the minimal description with fewest non zero parameters.
	Most models for strong correlation \textit{assume} two body forms which appears to work well in practice, 
	but is not guaranteed on mathematical grounds. (Even though the Coulomb operator is two body, 
	its low energy description need not be.) In this regard, DMD could also be used to assess 
	the accuracy of commonly used Hamiltonians and associated parameter sets.
	\item Other (non QMC) wavefunction based electronic structure methods:
	There are several wavefunction based quantum chemistry 
	methods for electronic structure like coupled cluster and ab initio DMRG which work primarily 
	directly in orbital space. These could also be potentially used in conjunction with DMD.
\end{itemize} 

In terms of applications, we hope the method will be eventually applied to solids involving transition 
metals and/or rare earth elements, which are in the strongly correlated regime due to the presence of localized orbitals. 
Some challenging areas include,
\begin{itemize} 
	\item Spin models for magnetism: 
	The magnetism associated with strongly correlated Mott insulators, compounded by effects such as geometrical frustration, 
	is highly non trivial and has seen immense research activity in the last few years. 
	For example, herbertsmithite harbors an exotic topological phase of matter - a "quantum spin liquid"~\cite{NormanRMP}; 
	lattice simulations of idealized kagome Heisenberg models~\cite{Yan_Huse_White, Changlani_kagome} have built evidence 
	for such a state amongst a zoo of many other low energy candidates. Thus, 
	downfolding such materials~\cite{Jeschke2013} appears to be a useful way for accessing low energy scales. 
	We caution that energy scales associated with magnetism can be in the meV range, and no electronic structure 
	method currently offers the accuracy needed to directly resolve such small energy differences without unbiased approximations. 
	It may thus be necessary to perform multiple downfolding steps to map from the Schroedinger equation to a spin model.
	\item Multi-band models for superconductors:
	As previously mentioned, unconventional (non BCS) superconductivity in materials such as the cuprates and iron based 
	pnictides has fuelled the study of strongly correlated systems.
	Several parameter sets exist in the literature for multi-band models, but it appears that there is little universal consensus. 
	We are optimistic that additional \textit{ab initio} inputs from DMD will help constrain the part of parameter 
	space relevant for these materials. Trends of the parameters, and the effectiveness of the multi-band model itself, 
	with pressure dependence and doping remain largely unexplored.  
\end{itemize} 
In summary, the DMD method offers a new route to connecting the worlds of lattice models and \textit{ab initio} approaches. 
We believe making this relationship precise will be crucial for a detailed and definitive 
understanding of strongly correlated quantum materials.
