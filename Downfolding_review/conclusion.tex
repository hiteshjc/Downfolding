\section{Conclusion and Future prospects}
The density matrix downfolding (DMD) technique uses data derived from low-energy approximate solutions to a high energy Hamiltonian to systematically determine an effective Hamiltonian that describes the low-energy behavior of the system.
It is based on several rather simple proofs which occupy a role similar to the variational principle; they allow us to know which effective models are closer to the correct solution than others. 
The method is very general and does not require a quasiparticle picture to apply, and neither does it have double-counting issues.
It treats all interactions on an equal footing, so hopping parameters are naturally modified by interaction parameters and so on.
While most of the applications have used the first principles quantum Monte Carlo method to obtain the low-energy solutions, the method is completely general and can be used with any solution method that can produce high quality energy and reduced density matrices.  
We have discussed several examples to present the conceptual and algorithmic aspects of DMD. 

The resultant lattice model can be efficiently and accurately solved for large system sizes~\cite{LeBlanc_PRX} using techniques designed and suited for small local Hilbert spaces; these include exact or selected diagonalization~\cite{DeRaedt,Tubman_selci,Holmes_Tubman_Umrigar}, density matrix renormalization group (DMRG)~\cite{White1992}, tensor networks~\cite{PEPS,Changlani_CPS,NeuscammanCPS}, dynamical mean field theory (DMFT)~\cite{Kotliar2006}, density matrix embedding (DMET)~\cite{DMET_2012} and lattice QMC methods~\cite{Scalapino, Trivedi_Ceperley, Zhang_AFQMC, Sandvik_loops, Prokofiev, 
Booth2009,SQMC,Holmes_Changlani_Umrigar, Booth2013}. 
These methods have also been used to obtain excited states, dynamical correlation functions and thermal properties, that have been difficult to obtain in \textit{ab initio} approaches. 


DMD, though conceptually simple, is still a method in its development stages, with room for algorithmic improvements and new applications. 
Advances in the field of inverse problems~\cite{Berg2017} could be incorporated into DMD to 
mitigate the problems associated with optimization and over-fitting. 
Here we briefly outline some aspects that need further research:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item The wave function database ($\ket{\Psi} \in \mathcal{LE}$):
	The DMD method relies crucially on the availability of a low energy space of \textit{ab initio} wave functions. While these wave functions do not have to be eigenstates, automating their construction remains challenging and realistically requires knowledge of the physics to be described.
	\item Optimal choice of basis functions. The second-quantized operators in the effective Hamiltonian correspond to a basis in the continuum. The quality of the model depends on the basis describing the changes between low-energy wave functions accurately.
	\item Form of the low energy model Hamiltonian. While the exact effective Hamiltonian is unique, there may be many ways of approximating it with varying levels of compactness and accuracy.
\end{enumerate} 
The advantage of the DMD framework is that all these can be resolved internally.
Given a good sampling of $\mathcal{LE}$, (2) and (3) can be resolved using regression. 
Given that (2) and (3) are correct or near correct, then (1) can be resolved by finding binding planes, as noted in Section~\ref{sec:theory}.
The method thus has a degree of self consistency; it will return low errors only when 1-3 are correct.

We have shown applications to strongly correlated models (3-band), {\it ab initio} bulk systems hydrogen chain and graphene, and a transition metal molecule FeSe.
The technique is on the verge of being applied to transition metal bulk systems; there are no major barriers to this other than a polynomially scaling computational cost and the substantial amount of work involved in parameterizing and fitting models to these systems.
Looking into the future, we anticipate that this technique can help with the definition of a correlated materials genome--what effective Hamiltonian best describes a given material is highly relevant to its behavior.
