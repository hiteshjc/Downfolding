Dear Editor, 

Please find attached our manuscript titled “From real materials to model Hamiltonians with density matrix downfolding”. The main aim of the paper is to address the challenge of modeling correlated systems for which the large-scale physics is not well-approximated by a non-interacting model. For these complex correlated systems, due to their material-specific details, it is challenge to construct low energy effective Hamiltonians that could describe and predict the macroscopic properties. There are many compounds of current interest such as the cuprates, graphene, herbertsmithite, pnictides etc, where the lack of knowledge of the precise effective Hamiltonian is a major roadblock to understanding their physical properties.

In this paper, we present a formal theory of quantitatively constructing low energy effective models through a density-matrix downfolding (DMD) approach. To do this, we use information provided from highly accurate ab initio simulations such as quantum Monte Carlo calculations. We map the downfolding problem into fitting the energy expectation values of wave functions sampled from a low-energy subspace of the full Hilbert space, using the reduced density matrices (RDMs) of the low energy wave functions. We elucidate the DMD method by several examples, including downfolding a three-band Hubbard model, a one-dimensional hydrogen chain, graphene and hydrogen honeycomb lattice, and a transition metal molecule. The DMD method provides a way to quantitative identify the importance of various interaction terms relevant to the macroscopic physics. 

We believe our work will be of general interest to the chemistry and physics communities, as it provides a route for bridging distinct, yet complementary, approaches for studying strongly correlated systems.
      
Yours sincerely,
