Transition metal systems are often difficult to model due to the many orbital and possibly magnetic descriptors introduced by $d$ electrons.
This is seen in the proliferation of models for transition metals, which include terms like spin-spin coupling, spin-orbital coupling, hopping, Hund's like coupling, and so on.
Models containing all possible descriptors are unwieldy, yet it is difficult to determine which degrees of freedom are needed for a minimal model to reproduce an interesting effect.
Transition metal oxide systems are challenging to describe using most electronic structure methods because of the strong electron correlations and multiple oxidation states possible in these systems. 
Fixed node DMC has been shown to be a highly accurate method on transition metal oxide materials, where it has been shown to improve the description of the ground state properties and energy gaps~\cite{Foyevtsova2014, Wagner_Abbamonte, Zheng2015, Wagner2016}. % for the types of orbital excitations used to sample the Hilbert space.
In this section, we apply DMD using fixed node DMC to quantify the importance of interaction parameters in a FeSe diatomic molecule with a bond length equal to that of the iron based superconductor, FeSe~\cite{kumar_crystal_2010}, in order to help identify the descriptors that may be relevant in the bulk material.

We considered a low-energy space spanned by the Se 4p, Fe 3d, and Fe 4s orbitals.
We sampled singles and doubles excitations from a reference Slater determinant of Kohn-Sham orbitals taken from PBE0 with total spin 0, 2, and 4, which were then multiplied by a Jastrow and further optimized using fixed node DMC.
After this procedure, 241 states were within an energy window of 8 eV from the ground state. 
Of these, eight states had a significant iron $4p$ component, which excludes them from the low-energy space.
This leaves us with 233 states in the low-energy subspace.

We consider a set of 21 possible descriptors consisting of local operators on the iron $4s$, iron $3d$ states, and selenium $4p$ states, which is a total of 9 single-particle orbitals.
We use the same IAO construction as Sec.~\ref{subsection:1dhydrogen} to generate the basis for these operators.
We consider orbital energy descriptors: 
\begin{align}
  &\epsilon_{s} n_s,&
  &\epsilon_{\pi,\mathrm{Se}} (n_{p_x} + n_{p_y}), &
  &\epsilon_{z} n_{p_z},&
  \\
  &\epsilon_{z^2} n_{d_{z^2}},& 
  &\epsilon_{\pi,\mathrm{Fe}} (n_{d_{xz}} + n_{d_{yz}}).& 
  &\epsilon_{\delta} (n_{d_{xy}} + n_{d_{x^2-y^2}}),&
\end{align}
We also consider the symmetry-allowed hopping terms:
\begin{align}
  &t_{\sigma,d} \sum_{\eta} \left( c_{d_{z^2},\eta}^{\dagger} c_{p_z,\eta} + \text{h.c.} \right),&
  &t_{\sigma,s} \sum_{\eta} \left(c_{s,\eta}^{\dagger}  c_{p_z,\eta} + \text{h.c.} \right),&
  &t_{\pi} \sum_{\eta} \left(c_{d_{xz},\eta}^{\dagger}  c_{p_x,\eta} + c_{d_{yz},\eta}^{\dagger}  c_{p_y,\eta} + \text{h.c.} \right).&
\end{align}
As before, $\eta$ represents the spin index.
We consider Hubbard interactions:
\begin{align}
  &U_p \sum_{i \in p} n_{i,\uparrow} n_{i,\downarrow},&
  &U_{d,\delta} \sum_{i\in \{d_{xy},d_{x^2-y^2}\}} n_{i,\uparrow} n_{i,\downarrow},&
  \\
  &U_d \sum_{i \in d} n_{i,\uparrow} n_{i,\downarrow},&
  &U_{d,\pi} \sum_{i\in \{d_{xz},d_{yz}\}} n_{i,\uparrow} n_{i,\downarrow},&
  &U_{d_{z^2}} n_{d_{z^2},\uparrow} n_{d_{z^2},\downarrow},&
\end{align}
where $p$ refers to the Se-$4p$ orbitals and $d$ refers to the Fe-$3d$ orbitals. 
We also consider Hund coupling terms for the iron atom:
\begin{align}
  &J \sum_{\substack{i\ne j \\i,j \in d}} S_i \cdot S_j,&
  &J_{\delta} S_{d_{xy}} \cdot S_{d_{x^2-y^2}},&
  &J_{\delta,d_{z^2}} (S_{d_{xy}} + S_{d_{x^2-y^2}}) \cdot S_{d_{z^2}},& \label{eqn:hund1}
  \\
  &J_{\pi} S_{d_{xz}} \cdot S_{d_{yz}},&
  &J_{\pi,d_{z^2}} (S_{d_{xz}} + S_{d_{yz}}) \cdot S_{d_{z^2}}.&
  &J_{\pi,\delta} (S_{d_{xz}} + S_{d_{yz}}) \cdot (S_{d_{xy}} + S_{d_{x^2-y^2}}),&
\end{align}
We also considered a nearest neighbor Hubbard interaction: $V \sum_{i\in p, j\in d} n_{i} n_j$.

To generate a minimal description of the system, we employed a matching pursuit (MP) method~\cite{MP_Zhang1993}.
Matching pursuit chooses to add descriptors based on their correlation with the residual of the linear fit. 
We started with a model that only consists of $E_0$. 
The Hund coupling descriptor (first term in Eqn~\ref{eqn:hund1}) has the largest correlation coefficient with the residual fit, so it is added first.
The fact that the Hund's coupling is chosen first in MP is consistent with the several studies in the literature, which find a prominent Hund's coupling can explain some of the properties of bulk FeSe.~\cite{demedici_hunds_2011,de_medici_janus-faced_2011,georges_strong_2013,busemeyer_competing_2016}.
Next, MP includes the descriptor that correlates most strongly with the residuals of this first minimal model, in this case the hopping between $d$ and $p$ $\sigma$ symmetry orbitals. 
We repeated this procedure until the RMS error did not improve more than 0.05 eV upon adding a new parameter.
This criterion was chosen to strike a balance between the complexity of the model and the accuracy in reproducing the sample set.

The following model was produced:
\begin{align}
  H_{eff}
  &=
  \epsilon_{\delta,\mathrm{Fe}} (n_{d_{xy}} + n_{d_{x^2-y^2}})
  +
  \epsilon_s n_{s}
  +
  \epsilon_{z} n_{p_z}
  \nonumber \\
  &+ 
  t_{\sigma,d} \sum_{\eta} \left( c_{d_{z^2},\eta}^{\dagger} c_{p_z,\eta} + \text{h.c.} \right)
  +
  t_{\sigma,s} \sum_{\eta} \left(c_{s,\eta}^{\dagger}  c_{p_z,\eta} + \text{h.c.} \right)
  \nonumber \\
  &+
  U_d \sum_{i \in d} n_{i,\uparrow} n_{i,\downarrow} 
  +
  J \sum_{\substack{i\ne j \\i,j \in d}} S_i \cdot S_j
  +
  E_0. \label{eq:fesemodel}
\end{align}
As before, $\eta$ is the spin index and $i$ is the orbital index, and $d$ is the set of iron $3d$ orbitals, as above.
$E_0$ is an overall energy shift, also included as a fit parameter.
The parameter values and corresponding error of each model produced by MP are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:fese}.
Note that all parameters may change at each step because the entire model is refitted in each iteration.
The parameters are smoothly varying with the inclusion of new parameters, and they take the correct signs based on symmetry (where applicable). 
The RMS error decreases with each additional parameter, but less so as the algorithm appends additional parameters. 
Eventually the diminishing improvements do not merit the additional complexity of more parameters.

    (Left) Parameter values for each fit generated in the MP algorithm, labeled at the step where they are included in the model. 
    A zero value indicates that parameter is not yet added to the model.
    The sign of $J$ is consistent with Hund's rules, and the signs of $t_{\sigma,d}$ and $t_{\sigma,s}$ are consistent with Se being located in positive $z$ with respect to Fe. 
    (Right) RMS error of each model generated by MP as the algorithm includes parameters. 
    The RMS error of the largest model considered was 0.61~eV.
