\subsection{One dimensional hydrogen chain}
\label{subsection:1dhydrogen}
We now move on to one of the simplest extended \emph{ab initio} systems, a hydrogen chain in one dimension with periodic boundary conditions. The one-dimensional hydrogen chain has been used as a model for validating a variety of modern \textit{ab initio} many-body methods \cite{H10_Simons}. 
We consider the case of $10$ atoms with periodic boundary conditions and work in a regime where the inter-atomic distance $r$ is in the range $1.5 - 3.0$ \AA, such that the system is  well described in terms of primarily $s$-like orbitals. 

For a given $r$, we first obtain single-particle Kohn-Sham orbitals from a set of spin-unrestricted and 
spin-restricted DFT-PBE calculations. The localized orbital basis upon which the RDMs (descriptors) 
are evaluated is obtained by generating intrinsic atomic orbitals (IAO) from the Kohn-Sham orbitals 
orthogonalized using the L\"owdin procedure (see Figure~\ref{fig:fit_quality}). These are the orbitals that enter the one-band Hubbard Hamiltonian. 
Then, to generate a database of wavefunctions needed for the DMD, we produce a set of Slater-Jastrow 
wavefunctions consisting of singles and doubles excitations to the Slater determinant:
\begin{subequations}
\begin{eqnarray}
| s \rangle = & e^J \Big[a^\dagger_{i \eta} a_{k \eta}   | KS \rangle \Big] \,,\\
| d \rangle = & \: e^J \Big[a^\dagger_{i \eta} a^\dagger_{j \eta'} a_{k \eta'} a_{l \eta}   | KS \rangle\Big] ,
\end{eqnarray}
\end{subequations}
where $|KS\rangle$ is the Slater determinant of occupied Kohn-Sham orbitals, $\eta$ and $\eta'$ are spin indices, \lucas{it is unclear here if $\eta$ and $\eta'$ are allowed to be different. }
and $a_{i}^\dagger$ ($a_{i}$) is a single-electron creation (destruction) operator corresponding to a particular Kohn-Sham orbital. $k,l$ refer to occupied orbitals in the original Slater determinant, while $i,j$ are virtual orbitals. 
$e^J$ is a Jastrow factor optimized by minimizing the variance of the local energy. 
We compute the energies (expectation values of the Hamiltonian) and the RDMs on all the wave functions within DMC. 
By computing the trace of the resulting 1-RDMs, we verify that all the electrons present in the system are represented within the localized basis of $s$-like orbitals. 
If the trace of the 1-RDM falls below the nominal number of electrons for a particular state,\lucas{be more specific. What are the thresholds?} it 
indicates that some higher-energy orbitals are occupied ($p$-like orbitals or  2s orbital), and that the state can not be described by the low-energy model Hamiltonian.\lucas{Are these very high energy states?}
 We exclude such states from the data set. 
The acquired data set is then used in DMD to downfold to a one-band Hubbard Hamiltonian.

\end{figure*}


Figure~\ref{fig:fit_quality} shows the fitting results of the energy functional $E[\Psi]$ within the sampled $\mathcal LE$ for two representative distances (1.5 and 2.25\AA). As we can see, the model $E_{eff}[\Psi]$ reproduces the \textit{ab-initio} $E[\Psi]$ with certain error. The fitting becomes better as distance increases. 

Figure~\ref{fig:Parameters-vs-Bond-t} shows the fitted values of the downfolding paramaters $t$ and $U/t$ at various distances. 
$t$ decreases as the interatomic distance increases, and the value of $U/t$ increases. The single-band Hubbard model qualitatively captures how the system approaches atomic limit. 
\lucas{What is the conclusion of this paragraph?}

\end{figure}

The R$^2$ value [see Figure~\ref{fig:Parameters-vs-Bond-t}(C)] shows that the single-band Hubbard model is a good description of the \textit{ab-initio} system at large distance but not at small distances. 
This is mainly because at small distance, the dynamics of other degree of freedoms (e.g. 2S and 2P orbitals) become important to the low energy spectrum; other interaction terms beyond the on-site Hubbard U, such as nearest-neighbor Coulomb interaction, and Heisenberg coupling also become important. 
Without including higher orbitals and other many-body interaction terms,  the model gives rise an incorrect insulator states for small distance. 
On the other hand, at large distance ($r>1.8$\AA), the system is at insulator phase \cite{Stella2011}, the model does give a better description.
