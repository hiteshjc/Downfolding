\subsection{One dimensional hydrogen chain}
We now move to one of the simplest extended \emph{ab-initio} systems, a hydrogen chain in one dimension with periodic boundary conditions. 
%%HHZ: We don't need to say exact eigenstates stuff.
%In the absence of availability of exact eigenstates, the example will highlight the effectiveness of the N-AIDMD approach. 
We consider the case of $10$ atoms and work in a regime where the inter-atomic distance $r$ is 
relatively large ($r=1.5$ to $3.0$ \AA), such that the system is potentially well described by a 1-band Hubbard model 
in terms of primarily $s$-like orbitals, whose form we discuss here. 

\HHZ{General comment for all of us: This is a physics paper, and the readers will mostly be physicists. Therefore, I think emphasizing physics quantities is more important than machine learning terminologies. I would say PHYSICS TERM (MACHINE LEARNING TERM) instead of MACHINE LEARNING TERM (PHYSICS TERM).} 
\lucas{What are you talking about specifically?} 

For a given $r$, we first obtain single-particle Kohn-Sham orbitals from a set of spin-unrestricted and 
spin-restricted DFT-PBE calculations. The localized orbital basis upon which the density matrices (descriptors) 
are evaluated is obtained by generating intrinsic atomic orbitals (IAO) from the Kohn-Sham orbitals 
\HHZ{Maybe Kiel could clarify, the Kohn-Sham orbitals used for constructing IAO are those from spin unpolarized calculation?} 
orthogonalized using the L\"owdin procedure. The resulting orbitals are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:h10orb}. These are the orbitals that enter the 1-band Hubbard Hamiltonian.

To generate a database of wavefunctions needed for the N-AIDMD, we produce a set of Slater-Jastrow 
wavefunctions consisting of singles- and doubles- excitations to the Slater determinant, 
\begin{subequations}
\begin{eqnarray}
| s \rangle = & \Big[a^\dagger_{i \sigma} a_{k \sigma}   | KS \rangle \Big]e^J \\
| d \rangle = & \: \Big[a^\dagger_{i \sigma} a^\dagger_{j \sigma'} a_{k \sigma'} c_{l \sigma}   | KS \rangle\Big]e^J ,
\end{eqnarray}
\end{subequations}
where $|KS\rangle$ is the Stater determinant of occupied Kohn-Sham orbitals, $\sigma$ and $\sigma'$ are spin indices, 
$a_{i}^\dagger$ ($a_{i}$) is a single-electron creation (destruction) corresponding to Kohn-Sham orbitals, 
and $e^J$ is the Jastrow factor which was optimized using variational Monte Carlo. 
We compute the energies (expectation values of the Hamiltonian) and the reduced density matrices (descriptors) on all the wave functions. 
%Then, having computed the energies (expectation values of the Hamiltonian) and corresponding 
%descriptors for these wavefunctions we verify the independence of the $U$ and $t$ descriptors. 
We then fit the 1-band Hubbard Hamiltonian using least-squares fitting according to the N-AIDMD formalism described in Sec. 2. %, as part of the formalism described in sec. 2.

\end{figure}
Fig.~\ref{fig:fit_quality} shows our N-AIDMD fits for two representative $r$. As expected, the RMS error 
is significantly smaller for larger $r$, verifying the effectiveness of the Hubbard model 
in this limit. 

Fig.~\ref{fig:Parameters-vs-Bond-t} also shows trends of the fitted value of $t$ 
and $U$ as a function of $r$. Consistent with physical intuition, $t$ decreases towards zero at larger $r$
and the value of $U/t$ rises. Based on these values and the extensive body of work in 1D systems, we expect a Luttinger liquid 
to insulator transition to occur at $U/t=...$ corresponding to $r=...$.

(Right) The ratio $U/t$ for the fitted parameter values as a function of interatomic separation. The ratio is small at lower bond-lengths, where $t$ is more relevant in describing the system, and larger at longer bond-lengths, where inter-site hopping is less significant. }\label{fig:Parameters-vs-Bond-t}
