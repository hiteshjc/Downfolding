\subsection{One dimensional hydrogen chain}
\label{subsection:1dhydrogen}
We now move on to one of the simplest extended \emph{ab initio} systems, a hydrogen chain in one dimension with periodic boundary conditions. The one-dimensional hydrogen chain has been used as a model for validating a variety of modern \textit{ab initio} many-body methods \cite{H10_Simons}. 
We consider the case of $10$ atoms with periodic boundary conditions and work in a regime where the inter-atomic distance $r$ is in the range $1.5 - 3.0$ \AA, such that the system is  well described in terms of primarily $s$-like orbitals. 

For a given $r$, we first obtain single-particle Kohn-Sham orbitals from a set of spin-unrestricted and 
spin-restricted DFT-PBE calculations. The localized orbital basis upon which the RDMs (descriptors) 
are evaluated is obtained by generating intrinsic atomic orbitals (IAO) \cite{knizia_intrinsic_2013} from the Kohn-Sham orbitals 
orthogonalized using the L\"owdin procedure (see Figure~\ref{fig:fit_quality}). These are the orbitals that enter the one-band Hubbard Hamiltonian. 
Then, to generate a database of wavefunctions needed for the DMD, we produce a set of Slater-Jastrow 
wavefunctions consisting of singles and doubles excitations to the Slater determinant:
\begin{subequations}
\begin{eqnarray}
| s \rangle = & e^J \Big[a^\dagger_{i \eta} a_{k \eta}   | KS \rangle \Big] \,,\\
| d \rangle = & \: e^J \Big[a^\dagger_{i \eta} a^\dagger_{j \eta'} a_{k \eta'} a_{l \eta}   | KS \rangle\Big] ,
\end{eqnarray}
\end{subequations}
where $|KS\rangle$ is the Slater determinant of occupied Kohn-Sham orbitals, $\eta \neq \eta'$ are spin indices, 
and $a_{i}^\dagger$ ($a_{i}$) is a single-electron creation (destruction) operator corresponding to a particular Kohn-Sham orbital. The $k,l$ indices label occupied orbitals in the original Slater determinant, while $i,j$ are virtual orbitals. 
$e^J$ is a Jastrow factor optimized by minimizing the variance of the local energy. 

We compute the energies (expectation values of the Hamiltonian) and the RDMs for each wave function within DMC. 
By computing the trace of the resulting 1-RDMs, we verify that all the electrons present in the system are represented within the localized basis of $s$-like orbitals. 
If the trace of the 1-RDM deviates from the nominal number of electrons for a particular state by more than some chosen threshold - 2\% in this example -
it indicates that some orbitals are occupied ($2s$- or $2p$-like orbitals for hydrogen)
that are not represented within the localized IAO basis used for computing the descriptors. 
Hence, these states do not exist within the $\mathcal{LE}$ space, and cannot be described by a one-band $s$-orbital model. We exclude such states from the wave function set. 
The acquired data is then used in DMD to downfold to a one-band Hubbard Hamiltonian.

Figure~\ref{fig:fit_quality} shows the fitting results of the energy functional $E[\Psi]$ within the sampled $\mathcal{LE}$ for two representative distances (1.5 and 2.25\AA). 
As seen in Figure~\ref{fig:fit_quality}, the model $E_{eff}[\Psi]$ reproduces the \textit{ab initio} $E[\Psi]$ up to certain error 
that decreases with atomic separation. That is, the fitted Hubbard model provides a more accurate description as separation distance increases, and the system becomes more atomic-like. 

Figure~\ref{fig:Parameters-vs-Bond-t} shows the fitted values of the downfolding parameters $t$ and $U/t$ at various distances. 
$t$ decreases as the interatomic distance increases, and the value of $U/t$ increases. The single-band Hubbard model qualitatively captures how the system approaches the atomic limit, in which $t$ becomes zero.

The R$^2$ values obtained from fitting the descriptors to the \textit{ab initio} energy [see Figure~\ref{fig:Parameters-vs-Bond-t}(C)] also show that the single-band Hubbard model is a good description of the system at large distances, but not at small distances. 
This is primarily because at small distances, the low energy spectrum involves the dynamics of other degrees of freedom not included in the effective model (e.g. $2s$ and $2p$ orbitals). Other interaction terms beyond the on-site Hubbard $U$, such as nearest-neighbor Coulomb interactions and Heisenberg coupling, can also become significant. 
Without including higher orbitals or additional many-body interaction terms, the model gives rise to an incorrect insulator state at small distances. 
Conversely, at larger separations ($r>1.8$\AA), where the system is in an insulator phase \cite{Stella2011}, the model provides a better description.
