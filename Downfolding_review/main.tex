\begin{abstract}
%Given a realistic quantum material with all its intrinsic complications, how does one develop a simple reliable model for understanding its properties? 
%Theoretical insight and effective Hamiltonians have been a key driver of this process leading to simple few-band pictures. 
%However, this is not an easy task, since the effective Hamiltonian involves a considerable change both of parameters and the form of the Hamiltonian with respect to the bare Coulomb values. 
%While the kinetic energy is dominated by contributions from bands or states energetically near the Fermi level, screened interactions depend on states even \textit{far} away from it, leading to Hubbard U's that have been traditionally hard to reliably determine. \lucas{reconsider previous sentence}
%Here we discuss an approach that treats the kinetic and potential parts\lucas{one-body and two-body?} of the Hamiltonian democratically, avoids ``double counting", and one\lucas{same one?} that provides a transparent way of obtaining effective Hamiltonians using data from many body wavefunctions, and whose validity can be systematically checked.\lucas{This is a run-on sentence}
Due to advances in computer hardware and new algorithms, it is now possible to perform highly accurate many-body simulations of realistic materials with all their intrinsic complications.
The success of these simulations leaves us with a conundrum: how do we extract useful physical models and insight from these simulations? 
In this article, we present a formal theory of downfolding--extracting an effective Hamiltonian from first-principles calculations. 
The theory maps the downfolding problem into fitting information derived from wave functions sampled from a low-energy subspace of the full Hilbert space. 
Since this fitting process most commonly uses reduced density matrices, we term it density matrix downfolding (DMD).
