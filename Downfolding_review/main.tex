\textbf{
Given a realistic material with all its intrinsic complications, how does one develop a 
simple reliable model for understanding its properties? Theoretical insight has been the key driver of 
this process leading to simple few-band pictures. When the interactions are comparable 
to or much stronger than the kinetic energy, it is convenient to adopt the real space lattice 
approach and work with Hubbard or Kanamori type Hamiltonians involving only the low energy electrons. 
But this is no easy task, since the effective Hamiltonian involves a considerable renormalization of parameters with respect 
to the bare Coulomb values. While the kinetic energy is dominated by contributions from bands or states energetically 
near the Fermi level, screened interactions depend on states even \emph{far} away from it, leading to Hubbard U's 
that have been traditionally hard to reliably determine. 
Here we discuss an approach that treats the kinetic and potential parts of the Hamiltonian 
democratically and one that provides a transparent way of obtaining effective Hamiltonians using data from many body wavefunctions, 
and whose validity can be systematically checked.
We emphasize that determining the effective Hamiltonian reliably is crucial for 
several applications in physics and chemistry not only for quantitative accuracy, but also a 
correct qualitative picture of strongly correlated materials.

\subsection{One dimensional hydrogen chain (Non-Eigenstate Fitting)}
%\subsection{One dimensional hydrogen chain (E-AIDMD)}
Let us consider the following single band model Hamiltonian,
\begin{eqnarray}\label{eq:h4model}
H &=& \sum_{i}\left\{-t[c^{\dagger}_{i\sigma}c_{i+1\sigma} +h.c.]+ Vn_{i}n_{i+1} + Un_{i\uparrow}n_{i\downarrow}+ J\vec \sigma_{i}\cdot \vec \sigma_{i+1}\right\} + C\,.
\end{eqnarray}
Here, $c_{i}$'s are Wannier orbitals generated from Kohn-Sham orbitals. We consider the case where the inter-atomic distance is relatively large, such that the system could be well described by a single band.  We start from the 4-site hydrogen chain with bond length equals to 2\AA with periodic boundary condition. We construct the Wannier orbitals by a unitary transformation of the four lowest energy Kohn-Sham states obtained from DFT/PBE calculation (2 occupied and 2 unoccupied). Fig.~\ref{fig:h4orb} shows the selected Kohn-Sham orbitals and constructed Wannier orbitals.

\end{figure}

%We will use the mentioned E-AIDMD method to downfold the ab initio system into the model Hamiltonian in Eq.~\eqref{eq:h4model} by matching the single-body energy spectra and the 1-body and 2-body reduced density matrices. The model Hamiltonian is solved by exact diagonization, whereas the \textit{ab initio} system is solved using diffusion Monte Carlo method with single Slater-Jastrow trial wave functions. 
%
%In our calculations, we used energies and RDMs of the following three states:
%\begin{subequations}
%\begin{eqnarray}
%S=0: \quad E = -2047.8(6) \text{mHa}; \\
%S=1: \quad E = -2038.9(5) \text{mHa}; \\
%S=2: \quad E = -1957.8(3) \text{mHa}.
%\end{eqnarray}
%\end{subequations}
%where S is the total angular moment of such the four-site hydrogen chain. In order to understand the relative importance of various two-body terms: (a) the on-site Hubbard interaction -- $\hat U$; (b) nearest neighbor Coulomb interaction -- $\hat V$; (c) nearest neighbor exchange -- $\hat J$, we compare the parameters obtained when downfolding the system to the following three different models with different two-body interactions,
%\begin{itemize}
%\item [(a)] \textbf{UVJ} model: onsite Hubbard interaction(U), nearest neighbor Coulomb (V) and exchange (J);
%\item [(b)] \textbf{UV} model: onsite Hubbard interaction(U), nearest neighbor Coulomb (V);  J is set to zero. 
%\item [(c)] \textbf{U} model: onsite Hubbard interaction(U). V and J are set to zero. 
%\end{itemize}
%
%The quality of downfolding is measured by the relative error of the two-body reduced density matrices, and the error of the eigen energies of the three states.
%\begin{eqnarray}
%R_{err} =\sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i,j,k,l}(M_{ijkl}^\text{ab initio} - M_{ijkl}^\text{model})^{2}}{\sum_{i,j,k,l}(M^\text{ab initio}_{ijkl})^{2} }}, \quad
%\Delta E = \sqrt{\sum_{i}|E_{i}^\text{ab initio} - E_{i}^{\text{model}}|^{2}}\,.
%\end{eqnarray}
%The resulting effective parameters are showed in Table.~\ref{tab:effm_hchain}. We see that all the three models can match the \textit{ab initio} data accurately. U model has relatively larger error in energy, but it is still comparable to the stochastic error from QMC (0.3 $\sim$ 0.5 mHa).

%\end{figure}
%In order to verify the transferability of the parameters for larger systems. We study longer chains (6-site, 8-site and 10-site) with the same inter-atomic distance (2\AA), and examine whether our parameters obtained from the 4-sites hydrogen chain is able to match the low energy physics of longer chains. We therefore, solve the model Hamiltonian with the parameters
%from Table.~\ref{tab:effm_hchain}, and examine the errors of the RDMs of S=0 and S=1 states. The results are
%shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:h4transfer}. As we can see, the error of the RDMs is around 10\%, indicating that the downfolding parameters from a smaller system is transferable to larger systems.
%Therefore, at $d=2$\AA, the hydrogen chain can be described by the extended Hubbard model \eqref{eq:h4model} very well. 

As an alternative to the model-fitting approach for hydrogen given above, we consider fitting a model to a periodic chain of 10 hydrogen atoms, but instead using low-energy states that do not explicitly target eigenstates of the Hamiltonian. In this example, we obtain single-particle Kohn-Sham orbitals from a set of spin-unrestricted and spin-restricted DFT-PBE calculations. With this set of orbitals, we produce a set of wave function states consisting of singles- and doubles- excitations to the Slater determinant. Allow $| S \rangle $ to be the Slater determinant formed from the Kohn-Sham orbitals, and orbitals $i$ and $j$ ($k$ and $l$) to be Kohn-Sham orbitals that are unoccupied (occupied) in the Slater determinant. We then produce new wave function states as singles excitations $|s \rangle$ and doubles excitations $| d \rangle$ excitations to the Slater determinant:
\begin{subequations}
\begin{eqnarray}
| s \rangle = & c^\dagger_{i \sigma} c_{k \sigma}   | S \rangle \\
| d \rangle = & \: c^\dagger_{i \sigma} c^\dagger_{j \sigma'} c_{k \sigma'} c_{l \sigma}   | S \rangle ,
\end{eqnarray}
\end{subequations}
where $\sigma$ and $\sigma'$ are spin indices and $c^\dagger$ ($c$) is a single-electron creation (destruction) operator. This technique does not access the explicit eigenstates of the Hamiltonian, but allows many more states to be sampled in the process of characterizing the low-energy Hilbert of space of the system. The localized orbital basis upon which the descriptors are calculated is obtained by generating intrinsic atomic orbitals (IAO) from the Kohn-Sham orbitals, and localizing them using the L\"owdin localization procedure.

Having produced a set of wave functions, we compute the total energies and descriptor values associated to each parameter that might appear in the model. The \textit{ab-initio} Hamiltonian is solved using diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) with Slater-Jastrow trial wave functions. Fig.~\ref{fig:Histogram-of-Parameter-Values} shows distributions for the $U$ and $t$ descriptors computed using this set of singly- and doubly-excited wave function states.  Because these descriptors vary in value between the distinct states we have constructed, it is appropriate to include both within a single model.

There will exist some correlation between any two given descriptors. If two descriptors strongly covary with one another, then including both of them in a single model will introduce strong co-linearities, and produce aphysical parameter estimates. To control for this, we compute the covariance between descriptors prior to fitting a model, to verify that the descriptors are describing independent features of the wave function set. Fig.~\ref{fig:Cov-of-Descriptors} shows the absolute covariance of the hopping-$t$ descriptor with the $U$, $J$, and $V$ descriptors as a function of the separation distance between the hydrogen ions. We see that the covariance between the $t$ and $U$ descriptors is consistently low across all separation distances, indicating that these parameters are describing different wave function features. Therefore these descriptors are not strongly correlated with one another, and it is appropriate to include both in a single model.

Having computed the energies and descriptors for this set of wave functions, and verified the independence of the $U$ and $t$ descriptors, we fit a Hubbard-type model to describe the \textit{ab-initio} energetic results. Fig.~\ref{fig:RMS-Error-vs-Bond} shows the RMS error in the resultant $U$-$t$ model, relative to the \textit{ab-initio} DMC energetics, as a function of the hydrogen inter-atomic separation. We observe the the error is consistently less than 2 eV. The fitted value of the one-body hopping $t$ as a function of separation is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:Parameters-vs-Bond-t}. As expected, the value of $t$ declines toward zero at larger separations. Hence, we see that the hydrogen chain can be well-described by a Hubbard-type model for a range of inter-atomic separations.

\section{Conclusion and Future prospects}
To summarize, we have explained the AIDMD method that we have been developing, primarily in conjunction with the 
\emph{ab-initio} QMC approach. The practical motivation is to take data from first principles (continuum) 
calculations as inputs for lattice model (discrete) methods. 
Since one is mapping a many body problem to a few body one, the relevant quantities of interest are 
the reduced density matrices associated with the many-body wavefunctions projected to a one-body space. 
The density matrix based approach is appealing as it is democratic 
in the determination of the hopping and interaction parts of the effective Hamiltonian, and provides multiple 
checks on its validity. We have discussed three representative examples to discuss the conceptual and algorithmic aspects of AIDMD. 

What sort of accuracy should one expect with effective Hamiltonians and AIDMD? The holy grail of quantum chemistry 
and electronic structure is to obtain an energy of 1 mHa (0.027 eV) per atom; this 
remains an open challenge despite decades of work. The effective Hamiltonian approach largely ameliorates this problem,  only 
relative energies are important, neither the total energy (nor its accuracy) is of particularly 
fundamental interest. This, of course, is contingent on the cancellation of the large energy associated with the core electrons, 
whose role is to primarily renormalize the interactions between the active (valence) electrons. This aspect can also 
be a major limitation when the core and active electrons are strongly entangled i.e when the separation of energy 
scales is not prominent (in which case an energy-dependent description may be needed). 
Thus, it is possibly best suited for extended systems (solids) where this separation exists. 
In our view, AIDMD (and downfolding in general) opens up many avenues for determination of physical 
quantities not easily calculated in ground state approaches. Our experience suggests excitation spectra 
can be accurately determined to 0.2 eV (or less)~\cite{Changlani2015} and potentially improved with 
more \emph{ab-initio} data and more refined effective Hamiltonians.  
%It is also possibly best suited for extended systems (solids) where there is often a clear separation of energy scales associated with the 
%core, active (valence) and virtual electronic spaces. 

Finally we would like to emphasize that AIDMD, though conceptually simple, 
is still a method in its development stages, with room for algorithmic improvements and new applications. It suffers 
from the usual problems of optimization and overfitting, but with advances in these fields we believe some of these major 
concerns may become less problematic. Some of the issues that need further research are,
\begin{itemize} 
	\item Construction of wavefunction database:
	The AIDMD method relies crucially on the availability of a low energy space of \emph{ab initio} wavefunctions, 
	which despite not being eigenstates, reveal the nature of the effective Hamiltonian. Automating its construction 
	remains somewhat challenging. We propose Slater Jastrow wavefunctions and deforming the orbitals entering the Slater 
	determinant as one way of probing the low energy manifold.
	\item Optimal choice of active orbitals (one body space):
	In the present work, we chose DFT orbitals (in a certain energy window) and localized them to get the one body orbitals. 
	The choice could only be justified based on looking at the trace of the 1-RDM and ensuring that it 
	equalled the expected number of electrons. We expect to use intrinisic atomic orbitals (pointed out to us by G. K. Chan) which 
	mitigate this issue. 
	\item Form of the low energy model Hamiltonian:
	Extensive work in the literature has been devoted to parameterizing compact effective Hamiltonians~\cite{Georges, Oles, Coury}. 
	Since the low energy effective Hamiltonian is not unique, there is not necessarily one right way of downfolding. 
	One could catalogue all functional forms based on previous parameterizations 
	or there may be some merit in determining the minimal description with fewest non zero parameters.
	Note that most models for strong correlation \emph{assume} two body forms. While this appears to work well in practice, 
	it is by not guaranteed on mathematical grounds. (Even though the Coulomb operator is two body, 
	its low energy description need not be.)
	\item Other (non QMC) wavefunction based electronic structure methods:
	There are several wavefunction based quantum chemistry 
	methods for electronic structure like coupled cluster and ab-initio DMRG which work primarily 
	directly in orbital space. These could also be potentially explored in conjunction with AIDMD.
	
\end{itemize} 

In terms of applications, we hope the method will be eventually applied to solids involving transition 
metals and/or rare earth elements, which are in the strongly correlated regime due to the presence of localized orbitals. 
Some challenging areas include,
\begin{itemize} 
	\item Spin models for magnetism: 
	The magnetism associated with strongly correlated Mott insulators, compounded by effects such as geometrical frustration, 
	is highly non trivial and has become an active area of research in its own right. 
	%This is compounded by 
	%the presence of geometric frustration, impurities and defects and 
	%spin-orbital effects. 
	For example, the two dimensional kagome lattice planes in 
	herbertsmithite harbor an exotic topological phase of matter - a "quantum spin liquid". While our understanding is primarily 
	from Heisenberg models~\cite{Yan_Huse_White, Changlani_kagome}, 
	contentious issues plague a complete understanding and connection to experiment (there has been recent progress 
	in downfolding herbertsmithite~\cite{Jeschke}). 
	Other areas of application include pyrochlore iridates and titanates and Kitaev materials. 
	We caution that relevant energy scales associated with magnetism can be $0.1$ meV or less, and no electronic structure 
	method is currently that accurate. It may thus be necessary to perform multiple downfolding steps to map from 
	the Schrodinger equation to a spin model.
	\item Multiband models for superconductors:
	As previously mentioned, unconventional (non BCS) superconductivity in materials such as the cuprates and iron based 
	pntictides has fuelled the study of strongly correlated systems.
	Several parameter sets exist in the literature for multi-band models, but it appears that there is little universal consensus. 
	We are optimistic that additional \emph{ab-initio} inputs from AIDMD will help constrain the part of parameter 
	space relevant for these materials. Trends of the parameters (and the effectiveness of the three band 
	or one band model itself) with pressure dependence and doping remain largely unexplored.  
	%\item Quantum computing (\HJC{tell me if this one is too weird}) : 
	%Quantum computers have been heralded as the future of computing with many promising advances. 
	%There has been progress in the simulation of small molecules in compact basis sets, but scalability (needed for solids) 
	%remains an issue. Downfolding macould help in the reduction in the number of active orbitals 
\end{itemize}
