\textbf{
Given a realistic material with all its intrinsic complications, how does one develop a 
simple reliable model for understanding its properties? Theoretical insight has been the key driver of 
this process leading to simple few-band pictures. When the interactions are comparable or much stronger than 
the kinetic energy, it is convenient to adopt the real space lattice approach and think in terms of Hubbard or Kanamori type 
Hamiltonians involving only the low energy electrons. 
But this is no easy task, since the effective Hamiltonian involves a considerable renormalization of parameters with respect 
to the bare Coulomb values. While the kinetic energy is dominated by contributions from bands or states energetically 
near the Fermi level, screened interactions depend on states even \emph{far} away from it, leading to Hubbard U's 
that have been traditionally hard to reliably determine. 
Here we discuss an approach that treats 
the kinetic and potential parts of the Hamiltonian democratically and one that provides a transparent way 
of obtaining effective Hamiltonians using data from many body wavefunctions, 
and whose validity can be systematically checked.
We emphasize that determining the effective Hamiltonian reliably is crucial for 
several applications in physics and chemistry not only for quantitative accuracy, but also a 
correct qualitative picture of strongly correlated materials.
