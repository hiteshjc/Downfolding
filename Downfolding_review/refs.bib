In particular, they compute the vibrational frequencies and binding energies of 26 first- and second-row diatomic molecules using post-Hartree-Fock methods, finding excellent agreement with the corresponding all-electron values. They also show their pseudopotentials give superior accuracy than other existing pseudopotentials constructed specifically for QMC. Finally, valence basis sets of different sizes ( V n Z with n = D , T , Q , 5 for first and second rows, and n = D , T for third to fifth rows) optimized for our pseudopotentials are also presented.},

In transition-metal oxides, the spectral function close to the Fermi level and low-energy excitations between d states have attracted particular attention. In this work we focus on photoemission spectra of vanadium dioxide over a wide (10 eV) range of binding energies. We show that there are clear signatures of the metal-insulator transition over the whole range due to a cross coupling of the delocalized s and p states with low-energy excitations between the localized d states. This coupling can be understood by advanced calculations based on many-body perturbation theory in the GW approximation. We also advocate the fact that tuning the photon energy up to the hard-x-ray range can help to distinguish fingerprints of correlation from pure band-structure effects.},

This colloquium first reviews experimental results and early theories of resistivity saturation. It then describes more recent theoretical work, addressing cases both where the Ioffe-Regel condition is satisfied and where it is violated. In particular, the authors show how the (semiclassical) Ioffe-Regel condition can be derived quantum mechanically under certain assumptions about the system and why these assumptions are violated for high-Tc cuprates and alkali-doped fullerides.},

We benchmark our method on the homogeneous electron gas in momentum space. The importance function used is the coupled cluster doubles wave function. We show that the computational resources required in our method scale polynomially with system size. Our energy upper bounds are in very good agreement with previous calculations of similar accuracy, and they can be systematically improved by including higher order excitations in the coupled cluster wave function.},

Correlated sampling is introduced to calculate small energy differences between different excitations. The usual pair-product (Slater-Jastrow) trial wave function is found to lack certain correlations entirely so that backflow correlation is crucial. From the excitation energies calculated here, we determine Fermi-liquid parameters and related physical quantities such as the effective mass and the Landï¿½ g factor of the system. Our results for the effective mass are compared with previous analytic calculations.},

The Gaussian exponents are optimized by directly minimizing the diffusion quantum Monte Carlo energy. We have carefully investigated and sought to minimize the potential biases in our Monte Carlo results. We conclude that the uniform electron gas undergoes a transition from a ferromagnetic fluid to a body-centered-cubic Wigner crystal at rs=106ï¿½1. The diffusion quantum Monte Carlo results are compared with those from Hartree-Fock and Hartree theory in order to understand the role played by exchange and correlation in Wigner crystals.

In order to get beyond this limit we explore the possibilities of multi-Pfaffian pairing wave functions.

By forming a weighted mean of the exchange charges, weighted and averaged over the various electronic wave functions at a given point of space, we set up an average potential field in which we can consider all of the electrons to move, thus leading to a great simplification of the Hartree-Fock method, and bringing it into agreement with the usual band picture of solids, in which all electron are assumed to move in the same field. We can further replace the average exchange charge by the corresponding value which we should have in a free-electron gas whose local density is equal to the density of actual charge at the position in question; this results in a very simple expression for the average potential field, which still behaves qualitatively like that of the Hartree-Fock method. This simplified field is being applied to problems in atomic structure, with satisfactory results, and is adapted as well to problems of molecules and solids.},

	abstract = {A theory of superconductivity is presented, based on the fact that the interaction between electrons resulting from virtual exchange of phonons is attractive when the energy difference between the electrons states involved is less than the phonon energy, ??. It is favorable to form a superconducting phase when this attractive interaction dominates the repulsive screened Coulomb interaction. The normal phase is described by the Bloch individual-particle model. The ground state of a superconductor, formed from a linear combination of normal state configurations in which electrons are virtually excited in pairs of opposite spin and momentum, is lower in energy than the normal state by amount proportional to an average (??)2, consistent with the isotope effect. A mutually orthogonal set of excited states in one-to-one correspondence with those of the normal phase is obtained by specifying occupation of certain Bloch states and by using the rest to form a linear combination of virtual pair configurations. The theory yields a second-order phase transition and a Meissner effect in the form suggested by Pippard. Calculated values of specific heats and penetration depths and their temperature variation are in good agreement with experiment. There is an energy gap for individual-particle excitations which decreases from about 3.5kTc at T=0ï¿½K to zero at Tc.

Several versions of the GW approximation with different levels of self-consistency exist in the field. While the GWA based on density functional theory (DFT) works well for conventional semiconductors{,} less is known about its reliability for strongly correlated semiconducting materials. Here we present a systematic study of the GWA using hematite ([small alpha]-Fe2O3) as the benchmark material. We analyze its performance in terms of the calculated photoemission/inverse photoemission band gaps{,} densities of states{,} and dielectric functions.

	abstract = {Resolving the interplay between magnetic interactions and structural properties in strongly correlated materials through a quantitatively accurate approach has been a major challenge in condensed matter physics. Here we apply highly accurate first principles quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) techniques to obtain structural and magnetic properties of the iron selenide (FeSe) superconductor under pressure. Where comparable, the computed properties are very close to the experimental values. Of potential ordered magnetic configurations, collinear spin configurations are the most energetically favorable over the explored pressure range. They become nearly degenerate in energy with bicollinear spin orderings at around 7 GPa, when the experimental critical temperature \$T\_c\$ is the highest. On the other hand, ferromagnetic, checkerboard, and staggered dimer configurations become relatively higher in energy as the pressure increases. The behavior under pressure is explained by an accurate analysis of the charge compressibility and the orbital occupation as described by the QMC many-body wave function, which reveals how spin, charge and orbital degrees of freedom are strongly coupled in this compound. This remarkable pressure evolution suggests that stripe-like magnetic fluctuations may be responsible for the enhanced \$T\_c\$ in FeSe and that higher T\$\_c\$ is associated with nearness to a crossover between collinear and bicollinear ordering.},

	abstract = {One of Feynman's early applications of path integrals was to superfluid He4. He showed that the thermodynamic properties of Bose systems are exactly equivalent to those of a peculiar type of interacting classical "ring polymer." Using this mapping, one can generalize Monte Carlo simulation techniques commonly used for classical systems to simulate boson systems. In this review, the author introduces this picture of a boson superfluid and shows how superfluidity and Bose condensation manifest themselves. He shows the excellent agreement between simulations and experimental measurements on liquid and solid helium for such quantities as pair correlations, the superfluid density, the energy, and the momentum distribution. Major aspects of computational techniques developed for a boson superfluid are discussed: the construction of more accurate approximate density matrices to reduce the number of points on the path integral, sampling techniques to move through the space of exchanges and paths quickly, and the construction of estimators for various properties such as the energy, the momentum distribution, the superfluid density, and the exchange frequency in a quantum crystal. Finally the path-integral Monte Carlo method is compared to other quantum Monte Carlo methods.},

	abstract = {We have applied the many-body ab initio diffusion quantum Monte Carlo (DMC) method to study Zn and ZnO crystals under pressure and the energetics of the oxygen vacancy,zincinterstitial, and hydrogen impurities in ZnO. We show that DMC is an accurate and practical method that can be used to characterize multiple properties of materials that are challenging for density functional theory(DFT) approximations. DMC agrees with experimental measurements to within 0.3 eV, including the band-gap of ZnO, the ionization potential of O and Zn, and the atomization energy of O2, ZnO dimer, and wurtzite ZnO. DMC predicts the oxygen vacancy as a deep donor with a formation energy of 5.0(2) eV under O-rich conditions and thermodynamic transition levels located between 1.8 and 2.5 eV from the valence band maximum. Our DMC results indicate that the concentration of zincinterstitial and hydrogen impurities in ZnO should be low under n-type and Zn- and H-rich conditions because these defects have formation energies above 1.4 eV under these conditions. Comparison of DMC and hybrid functionals shows that these DFT approximations can be parameterized to yield a general correct qualitative description of ZnO. However, the formation energy of defects in ZnO evaluated with DMC and hybrid functionals can differ by more than 0.5 eV.},

The quasiparticle bandgap was also computed, and the DMC result of 4.72 (0.17) eV compares well with the experimental value of 4.3 eV. Furthermore, DMC calculations of excited states at the L, Z, and the gamma point of the Brillouin zone reveal a flat upper valence band for NiO, in good agreement with Angle Resolved Photoemission Spectroscopy results. To study defect properties, we evaluated the formation energies of the neutral and charged vacancies of oxygen and nickel in NiO. A formation energy of 7.2 (0.15) eV was found for the oxygen vacancy under oxygen rich conditions. For the Ni vacancy, we obtained a formation energy of 3.2 (0.15) eV under Ni rich conditions. These results confirm that NiO occurs as a p-type material with the dominant intrinsic vacancy defect being Ni vacancy.},

	issn = {0028-0836},
	abstract = {Phase competition underlies many remarkable and technologically important phenomena in transition metal oxides. Vanadium dioxide (VO2) exhibits a first-order metal?insulator transition (MIT) near room temperature, where conductivity is suppressed and the lattice changes from tetragonal to monoclinic on cooling. Ongoing attempts to explain this coupled structural and electronic transition begin with two alternative starting points: a Peierls MIT driven by instabilities in electron?lattice dynamics and a Mott MIT where strong electron?electron correlations drive charge localization. A key missing piece of the VO2 puzzle is the role of lattice vibrations. Moreover, a comprehensive thermodynamic treatment must integrate both entropic and energetic aspects of the transition. Here we report that the entropy driving the MIT in VO2 is dominated by strongly anharmonic phonons rather than electronic contributions, and provide a direct determination of phonon dispersions. Our ab initio calculations identify softer bonding in the tetragonal phase, relative to the monoclinic phase, as the origin of the large vibrational entropy stabilizing the metallic rutile phase. They further reveal how a balance between higher entropy in the metal and orbital-driven lower energy in the insulator fully describes the thermodynamic forces controlling the MIT. Our study illustrates the critical role of anharmonic lattice dynamics in metal oxide phase competition, and provides guidance for the predictive design of new materials.},

	copyright = { 2013 Nature Publishing Group, a division of Macmillan Publishers Limited. All Rights Reserved.},
	issn = {0028-0836},
	abstract = {First-order phase transitions in solids are notoriously challenging to study. The combination of change in unit cell shape, long range of elastic distortion and flow of latent heat leads to large energy barriers resulting in domain structure, hysteresis and cracking. The situation is worse near a triple point, where more than two phases are involved. The well-known metal?insulator transition in vanadium dioxide, a popular candidate for ultrafast optical and electrical switching applications, is a case in point. Even though VO2 is one of the simplest strongly correlated materials, experimental difficulties posed by the first-order nature of the metal?insulator transition as well as the involvement of at least two competing insulating phases have led to persistent controversy about its nature. Here we show that studying single-crystal VO2 nanobeams in a purpose-built nanomechanical strain apparatus allows investigation of this prototypical phase transition with unprecedented control and precision. Our results include the striking finding that the triple point of the metallic phase and two insulating phases is at the transition temperature, Ttr = Tc, which we determine to be 65.0 ï¿½ 0.1 ï¿½C. The findings have profound implications for the mechanism of the metal?insulator transition in VO2, but they also demonstrate the importance of this approach for mastering phase transitions in many other strongly correlated materials, such as manganites and iron-based superconductors.},

Exchange and correlation are treated with the local spin density or generalized gradient approximations. The basis functions and the electron density are projected on a real-space grid, in order to calculate the Hartree and exchange-correlation potentials and matrix elements, with a number of operations that scales linearly with the size of the system. We use a modified energy functional, whose minimization produces orthogonal wavefunctions and the same energy and density as the {Kohn-Sham} energy functional, without the need of an explicit orthogonalization. Additionally, using localized Wannier-like electron wavefunctions allows the computation time and memory, required to minimize the energy, to also scale linearly with the size of the system. Forces and stresses are also calculated efficiently and accurately, thus allowing structural relaxation and molecular dynamics simulations.},

The interplay of strong electronic Coulomb interactions and structural distortions, in particular, the dimerization of vanadium atoms in the low-temperature phase, plays a crucial role.

Clean surfaces were obtained by annealing the films in an oxygen atmosphere. Spectral weight transfer between the coherent and incoherent parts accompanying the metal-insulator transition was clearly observed. We also observed a hysteretic behavior of the spectra for heating-cooling cycles. We have derived the bulk spectrum of the metallic phase and found that it has a strong incoherent part. The width of the coherent part is comparable to that given by band-structure calculation in spite of its reduced spectral weight, indicating that the momentum dependence of the self-energy is significant. This is attributed to by ferromagnetic fluctuation arising from Hunds rule coupling between different d orbitals as originally proposed by Zylbersztejn and Mott. In the insulating phase, the width of the V 3d band shows strong temperature dependence. We attribute this to electron-phonon interaction and have reproduced it using the independent boson model with a very large coupling constant.},

	volume = {185},
	abstract = {Optical, thermal, magnetic, and transport properties of VO$_2$ in the vicinity of the semiconductor-metal transition temperature of {68ï¿½C} are discussed in terms of a simple one-electron band picture. Particular emphasis is placed on the variation in these properties from sample to sample. It is shown that all of the available experimental data can be qualitatively explained in terms of such a model. In the metallic state, there are at least two overlapping and partially occupied bands, resulting in a complex Fermi surface characterized by a conductivity effective mass near unity and carrier mobilities in the range between 1 and 10 {cm2/V} sec. There is no consistent evidence of a very narrow high-mass band near the Fermi level. In the semiconductor state, it is probable that the band overlap described above is removed by the lattice distortion, resulting in an energy gap of approximately 0.6 to 0.7 {eV.} This energy gap is filled to a density of typically 1019 to 1020 cm-3 with donorlike and acceptorlike states, the energy distribution and density depending on the sample, so that it is impossible to obtain an accurate measure of the energy gap. The charge density associated with these donorlike and acceptorlike states is normally larger than that associated with the carriers in the band, resulting in electronic properties characteristic of heavily compensated semiconductors. The conduction-band effective mass and the electron mobility are both near unity in the semiconducting phase of {VO2.} Some implications of these experimental results with respect to the application to VO$_2$ of several of the published theories on semiconductor-metal transitions in solids are pointed out.},

	abstract = {Vanadium dioxide has various potential applications in electronics due to the metal-insulator transition ({MIT).} It is known that oxide structures with nanometric dimensions exhibit properties different from bulk oxide materials because of the spatial confinement and the proximity of the substrate. However, in order to integrate VO$_2$ into the thriving nano-scale electronics, it is necessary to explore the {MIT} in this material in thin film nano-structures. In this work, it is shown that there is a fundamental dimensional restriction for the transition to occur even for pure epitaxial VO$_2$ nano-films and nano-wires. This is associated with the fact that any phase transition turns out to be impossible when the system size is decreased below a certain characteristic length dc. This dimension is estimated to be dc  Î¾ (where Î¾ is the correlation length,  2 nm for {VO2)}, and, on the basis of the available experimental data, it is shown that the transition temperature falls as the characteristic size (film thickness or nano-wire radius) diminishes, though the predicted theoretical limit of 2 nm is not still experimentally achieved by now. Experimental results concerning the dependence of the threshold voltage on the film thickness at {MIT-induced} switching in VO$_2$ based sandwich structures are presented. Finally, the comparison of the authors' experimental data with the literature data, as well as with the analogous features of superconducting phase transitions, is carried out.},

As a result we can address, in a quasi-exact way, tens of thousands of quantum spins with a computational effort that scales logarithmically in the systems size. The calculations unveil that ground state entanglement in extended quantum systems is organized in layers corresponding to different length scales.

The key idea of the formulation is that rather than keep the lowest-lying eigenstates of the Hamiltonian in forming a new effective Hamiltonian of a block of sites, one should keep the most significant eigenstates of the block density matrix, obtained from diagonalizing the Hamiltonian of a larger section of the lattice which includes the block. This approach is much more accurate than the standard approach; for example, energies for the S=1 Heisenberg chain can be obtained to an accuracy of at least 10-9. The method can be applied to almost any one-dimensional quantum lattice system, and can provide a wide variety of static properties.},

We consider a disk in the plane, with a smooth boundary of length L, large compared to the correlation length. In the ground state, by tracing out all degrees of freedom in the exterior of the disk, we obtain a marginal density operator {\textbackslash}rho for the degrees of freedom in the interior. The von Neumann entropy S({\textbackslash}rho) of this density operator, a measure of the entanglement of the interior and exterior variables, has the form S({\textbackslash}rho)= {\textbackslash}alpha L -{\textbackslash}gamma + ..., where the ellipsis represents terms that vanish in the limit L{\textbackslash}to{\textbackslash}infty. The coefficient {\textbackslash}alpha, arising from short wavelength modes localized near the boundary, is nonuniversal and ultraviolet divergent, but -{\textbackslash}gamma is a universal additive constant characterizing a global feature of the entanglement in the ground state. Using topological quantum field theory methods, we derive a formula for {\textbackslash}gamma in terms of properties of the superselection sectors of the medium.},

Here we consider some special problems that arise when the microscopic model is taken to be relativistic quantum field theory. These problems are associated with the existence of an infinite number of degrees of freedom per unit volume. Because of these the microscopic entropy can, and typically does, diverge for sharply localized states. However the difference in the entropy between two such states is better behaved, and for most purposes it is the useful quantity to consider. In particular, a renormalized entropy can be defined as the entropy relative to the ground state. We make these remarks quantitative and precise in a simple model situation: the states of a conformal quantum field theory excited by a moving mirror. From this work, we attempt to draw some lessons concerning the ``information problem'' in black hole physics},

These correlations are not due to thermal fluctuations but to the intricate structure of a strongly entangled ground state of the system. We present a microscopic computation of the scaling properties of the ground-state entanglement in several {1D} spin chain models both near and at the quantum critical regimes. We quantify entanglement by using the entropy of the ground state when the system is traced down to {\$L\$} spins. This entropy is seen to scale logarithmically with {\$L\$}, with a coefficient that corresponds to the central charge associated to the conformal theory that describes the universal properties of the quantum phase transition. Thus we show that entanglement, a key concept of quantum information science, obeys universal scaling laws as dictated by the representations of the conformal group and its classification motivated by string theory. This connection unveils a monotonicity law for ground-state entanglement along the renormalization group flow. We also identify a majorization rule possibly associated to conformal invariance and apply the present results to interpret the breakdown of density matrix renormalization group techniques near a critical point.},

The role of topology as an underlying description of order has since branched out to include topological band insulators and certain featureless gapped Mott insulators with a topological degeneracy in the ground-state wavefunction. Despite intense work, very few candidates for such topologically ordered spin liquids exist. The main difficulty in finding systems that harbour spin-liquid states is the very fact that they violate the Landau paradigm, making conventional order parameters non-existent. Here, we describe a spin-liquid phase in a {BoseHubbard} model on the kagome lattice, and determine its topological order directly by means of a measure known as topological entanglement entropy. We thus identify a non-trivial spin liquid through its entanglement entropy as a gapped ground state with emergent Z2 gauge symmetry.},

Replacing the determinant of LDA orbitals in the wave function by a determinant of natural orbitals makes no significant difference to the quality of the wave function?s nodal surface, leaving the diffusion Monte Carlo energy unchanged.

The large corrections to the Koopmans values for the three lowest ionization potentials (IP's) are analyzed by setting up the effective hamiltonian matrix for each ionized state. The most important correction terms to the IP of an orbital, v, result from the type of excitations, ij ? k? (ij ?v), where ij ? k? denotes that an electron in one of the occupied orbitals, either ?i or ?j, is excited to the vacant orbital, ?k and simultaneously an electron in the other orbital is ionized. The excitation ij ? k? can be shown to be an intramolecular charge-transfer excitation in terms of the valence bond picture. It is this large mixing of the v ? ? and the ij ? k? states that is responsible for the strong shake-up bands in the region of 24-32 eV in the photoelectron spectra. The calculated IP's for the three lowest single hole states and for the five shake-up states are in good agreement with experimental values. For comparison, the IP's of CO are also studied.},

We assess the performances of the EKT approaches based on orbital-optimized methods [Bozkaya, U. J. Chem.

Especially, results of the OCEPA(0) method (with the aug-cc-pVQZ basis set) for EAs of the considered atoms and molecules are very promising, the corresponding mean absolute errors are 0.14 and 0.17 eV, respectively.},

  abstract={An algorithm for the simulation of the evolution of slightly entangled quantum states has been recently proposed as a tool to study time-dependent phenomena in one-dimensional quantum systems. Its key feature is a time-evolving block-decimation (TEBD) procedure to identify and dynamically update the relevant, conveniently small, subregion of the otherwise exponentially large Hilbert space. Potential applications of the TEBD algorithm are the simulation of time-dependent Hamiltonians, transport in quantum systems far from equilibrium and dissipative quantum mechanics. In this paper we translate the TEBD algorithm into the language of matrix product states in order to both highlight and exploit its resemblances to the widely used density-matrix renormalization-group (DMRG) algorithms. The TEBD algorithm, being based on updating a matrix product state in time, is very accessible to the DMRG community and it can be enhanced by using well-known DMRG techniques, for instance in the event of good quantum numbers. More importantly, we show how it can be simply incorporated into existing DMRG implementations to produce a remarkably effective and versatile 'adaptive time-dependent DMRG' variant, that we also test and compare to previous proposals.}

@article{Alavi_FCIQMC,
abstract = {We have developed a new quantum Monte Carlo method for the simulation of correlated many-electron systems in full configuration-interaction (Slater determinant) spaces. The new method is a population dynamics of a set of walkers, and is designed to simulate the underlying imaginary-time Schr\"{o}dinger equation of the interacting Hamiltonian. The walkers (which carry a positive or negative sign) inhabit Slater determinant space, and evolve according to a simple set of rules which include spawning, death and annihilation processes. We show that this method is capable of converging onto the full configuration-interaction (FCI) energy and wave function of the problem, without any a priori information regarding the nodal structure of the wave function being provided. Walker annihilation is shown to play a key role. The pattern of walker growth exhibits a characteristic plateau once a critical (system-dependent) number of walkers has been reached. At this point, the correlation energy can be measured using two independent methods--a projection formula and a energy shift; agreement between these provides a strong measure of confidence in the accuracy of the computed correlation energies. We have verified the method by performing calculations on systems for which FCI calculations already exist. In addition, we report on a number of new systems, including CO, O(2), CH(4), and NaH--with FCI spaces ranging from 10(9) to 10(14), whose FCI energies we compute using modest computational resources.},

  volume={12},
  number={10},
  pages={103008},
  year={2010},
  abstract={We present a class of tensor network states specifically designed to capture the electron correlation within a molecule of arbitrary structure. In this ansatz, the electronic wave function is represented by a complete-graph tensor network (CGTN) ansatz, which implements an efficient reduction of the number of variational parameters by breaking down the complexity of the high-dimensional coefficient tensor of a full-configuration-interaction (FCI) wave function. This ansatz applied to molecules is new and based on a tensor network wave function recently studied in lattice problems. We demonstrate that CGTN states approximate ground states of molecules accurately by comparison of the CGTN and FCI expansion coefficients. The CGTN parametrization is not biased towards any reference configuration, in contrast to many standard quantum chemical methods. This feature allows one to obtain accurate relative energies between CGTN states, which is central to molecular physics and chemistry. We discuss the implications for quantum chemistry and focus on the spin-state problem. Our CGTN approach is applied to the energy splitting of states of different spins for methylene and the strongly correlated ozone molecule at a transition state structure. The parameters of the tensor network ansatz are variationally optimized by means of a parallel-tempering Monte Carlo algorithm.}

The variational approach is a way of applying the density matrix renormalization group method (DMRG) to infinite size 2D quantum systems.},

These methods are exact for systems of slowly varying or high density. For the ground state, they lead to self-consistent equations analogous to the Hartree and {Hartree-Fock} equations, respectively. In these equations the exchange and correlation portions of the chemical potential of a uniform electron gas appear as additional effective potentials. {(The} exchange portion of our effective potential differs from that due to Slater by a factor of 2/3.) Electronic systems at finite temperatures and in magnetic fields are also treated by similar methods.

For this research, we performed a Rietveld analysis of synchrotron radiation x-ray diffraction data, O K x-ray absorption spectroscopy, V L3 resonant inelastic x-ray scattering, and magnetic-susceptibility measurements. This study reveals an unusual low-temperature phase that involves the formation of an elongated and less-tilted V-V pair, a narrowed energy gap, and an induced paramagnetic contribution from the nanoparticles. We show that the change in the crystal structure is consistent with the change in the electronic states around the Fermi level, which leads us to suggest that the Peierls mechanism contributes to the energy splitting of the a1g state. Furthermore, we find that the high-temperature rutile structure of the nanoparticles is almost identical to that of the microparticles.},

  abstract   = {We present a model of the VO$_2$ phase transition which incorporates both electron-electron and electron-lattice interactions and accounts for the presence of two d bands (Ï* and d) overlapping at the Fermi level of the metallic phase. Attention is given to the crystallographic symmetry change at the transition and to the properties of the associated order parameter. To take into account electron-electron interaction, we use the functional-integral treatment of the Hubbard Hamiltonian. Then, to account for the electron-lattice interaction, the center of gravity and the shape of the d bands are chosen so as to depend explicitly on the lattice distortion. Finally spin-spin interactions are described in terms of an Ising-like model. This treatment leads to a free energy expression which, at a given temperature, depends on two variational parameters: the mean amplitude of the local moment Î¼ and the amplitude of the lattice distortion Î·. Minimization of the free energy with respect to Î· and Î¼ leads to the temperature dependence of these quantities. The transition which is a first-order one, appears to be driven by electron correlations which, below the transition temperature, stabilize a distorted phase with paired local magnetic moments on the vanadium sites and a density of states gap between the lower Hubbard d and the Ï* band. Our model lends itself to discussion of the magnetic susceptibility which, in the insulating phase, is governed by the pairing of the local magnetic moments, induced by the electron-lattice interaction. Using accepted values of the electronic structure parameters, we find a fairly quantitative agreement with experiment. We account for all the features of the ferroelastic, metal-insulator transition of {VO2.}},

  abstract = {The fully relativistic {Dirac-Fock} generalizations of non-relativistic {Phillips-Kleinman} and generalized {Phillips-Kleinman} pseudopotentials are used to derive pseudopotential theories based on the SchrÃ¶dinger hamiltonian which incorporate relativistic effects. In the theory in which all the orbitals are treated to the lowest non-vanishing order (1/c 2), the relativistic corrections to the energies are obtained by taking the expectation value of a perturbing operator over the non-relativistic wavefunctions. This perturbation consists of coulomb and exchange operators built from the relativistically induced changes in the charge distributions of other orbitals and two new operators arising from the pseudopotential, in addition to the standard mass-velocity, spin-orbit coupling and Darwin terms. The leading corrections to {Hartree-Fock} theory are obtained by omitting the pseudopotential operators and correct two expressions reported previously. The relative contributions of the standard operators and the coulomb plus exchange terms provide a quantitative measure of the relative importance of the direct and indirect relativistic effects. It is shown that, for a nodeless pseudo-orbital having a low amplitude in the inner spatial regions, the direct contribution is dominated by the two perturbations originating in the pseudopotential. The further operators arising for open shell systems are derived. The possibility of extending the theory to higher order than 1/c 2 is discussed and it is concluded that whilst this is not possible in {Hartree-Fock} theory, non-divergent higher-order corrections to the pseudopotential can be derived. A pseudopotential theory is developed in which the core orbitals are treated exactly, the pseudopotential contributions to valence orbitals to order 1/c 4 and the remaining valence orbital contributions to order 1/c 2.},

  abstract = {Vanadium dioxide (VO2) is a paradigmatic example of a strongly correlated system that undergoes a metal-insulator transition at a structural phase transition. To  year, this transition has necessitated significant post hoc adjustments to theory in order to be described properly. Here we report standard state-of-the-art first principles quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) calculations of the structural dependence of the properties of VO2. Using this technique, we simulate the interactions between electrons explicitly, which allows for the metal-insulator transition to naturally emerge, importantly without ad hoc adjustments. The QMC calculations show that the structural transition directly causes the metal-insulator transition and a change in the coupling of vanadium spins. This change in the spin coupling results in a prediction of a momentum-independent magnetic excitation in the insulating state. While two-body correlations are important to set the stage for this transition, they do not change significantly when VO2 becomes an insulator. These results show that it is now possible to account for electron correlations in a quantitatively accurate way that is also specific to materials.},

We performed inelastic x-ray scattering experiments on crystals of graphite and applied reconstruction algorithms to image the dynamical screening of charge in a freestanding graphene sheet. We found that the polarizability of the Dirac fermions is amplified by excitonic effects, improving screening of interactions between quasiparticles. The strength of interactions is characterized by a scale-dependent, effective fine-structure constant, , the value of which approaches  at low energy and large distances. This value is substantially smaller than the nominal , suggesting that, on the whole, graphene is more weakly interacting than previously believed.},

  abstract = {Using quantum Monte Carlo and finite-size scaling for the Hubbard model, we find evidence of a zero-temperature transition between the nonmagnetic semi-metal and an antiferromagnetic insulator in the 2D honeycomb lattice for a nontrivial value of U / tï¿½=ï¿½4.5ï¿½0.5. The corresponding transition in Hartree-Fock mean field is at U / tï¿½=ï¿½2.23, which indicates the importance of quantum fluctuations. This represents the first example of Mott-Hubbard transition in a 2D bipartite lattice. Similar transitions are predicted for special lattices in higher dimensions, in particular for the 3D diamond lattice.},

This insulating phase is proposed to be the long-sought ``resonating-valence-bond'' state or ``quantum spin liquid'' hypothesized in 1973. This insulating magnetic phase is favored by low spin, low dimensionality, and magnetic frustration. The preexisting magnetic singlet pairs of the insulating state become charged superconducting pairs when the insulator is doped sufficiently strongly. The mechanism for superconductivity is hence predominantly electronic and magnetic, although weak phonon interactions may favor the state. Many unusual properties are predicted, especially of the insulating state.},

This is defined as the von Neumann entropy {S\_A=-Tr} {rho\_A} log {rho\_A} corresponding to the reduced density matrix {rho\_A} of a subsystem A. For the case of a 1+1-dimensional critical system, whose continuum limit is a conformal field theory with central charge c, we re-derive the result {S\_A{\textbackslash}sim(c/3)} log(l) of Holzhey et al. when A is a finite interval of length l in an infinite system, and extend it to many other cases: finite systems,finite temperatures, and when A consists of an arbitrary number of disjoint intervals. For such a system away from its critical point, when the correlation length {\textbackslash}xi is large but finite, we show that {S\_A{\textbackslash}sim{{\textbackslash}cal} A}(c/6){\textbackslash}log{\textbackslash}xi, where {\textbackslash}cal A is the number of boundary points of A. These results are verified for a free massive field theory, which is also used to confirm a scaling ansatz for the case of finite-size off-critical systems, and for integrable lattice models, such as the Ising and {XXZ} models, which are solvable by corner transfer matrix methods. Finally the free-field results are extended to higher dimensions, and used to motivate a scaling form for the singular part of the entanglement entropy near a quantum phase transition.},

Reviewing past applications of DMRG in 2D demonstrates its success in treating a wide variety of problems, although it remains underutilized in this context. We present techniques for performing cutting-edge 2D DMRG studies including methods for ensuring convergence, extrapolating finite-size data, and extracting gaps and excited states. Finally, we consider a selection of recently developed 2D tensor network methods and compare the performance of one of these to 2D DMRG. },

For this research, we performed a Rietveld analysis of synchrotron radiation x-ray diffraction data, O K x-ray absorption spectroscopy, V L3 resonant inelastic x-ray scattering, and magnetic-susceptibility measurements. This study reveals an unusual low-temperature phase that involves the formation of an elongated and less-tilted V-V pair, a narrowed energy gap, and an induced paramagnetic contribution from the nanoparticles. We show that the change in the crystal structure is consistent with the change in the electronic states around the Fermi level, which leads us to suggest that the Peierls mechanism contributes to the energy splitting of the a1g state. Furthermore, we find that the high-temperature rutile structure of the nanoparticles is almost identical to that of the microparticles.},

This estimate (IPEKT) is obtained as an eigenvalue of a generalized eigenvalue problem. Katriel and Davidson provided a proof [Katriel, J.; Davidson, E. R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., 1980, 77, 1403.] that the EKT predicts the exact lowest IP for ground states of Coulomb systems. However, subsequently, several articles have been published challenging the exactness of the EKT and providing disproofs. This apparent contradiction is resolved by demonstrating that the lowest eigenvalue of the generalized Koopmans? procedure does, in general, not exist. This explains why contradictory results are obtained about the lowest IPEKT since its existence has implicitly been assumed. Nonetheless, it will also be shown here that the generalized Koopmans? approach gives IPs that are arbitrarily close to the exact lowest ionization energy. The eigenvalues obtained according to the EKT have an accumulation point given by the exact lowest IP.},

  abstract   = {The extended Koopmans\&apos; theorem (EKT) provides a straightforward way to compute ionization potentials (IPs) from any level of theory, in principle. However, for non-variational methods, such as MÃ¸llerâPlesset perturbation and coupled-cluster theories, the EKT computations can only be performed as by-products of analytic gradients as the relaxed generalized Fock matrix (GFM) and one- and two-particle density matrices (OPDM and TPDM, respectively) are required [J. Cioslowski, P. Piskorz, and G. Liu, J. Chem. Phys.107, 6804 (1997)]. However, for the orbital-optimized methods both the GFM and OPDM are readily available and symmetric, as opposed to the standard post HartreeâFock (HF) methods. Further, the orbital optimized methods solve the N-representability problem, which may arise when the relaxed particle density matrices are employed for the standard methods, by disregarding the orbital Z-vector contributions for the OPDM. Moreover, for challenging chemical systems, where spin or spatial symmetry-breaking problems are observed, the abnormal orbital response contributions arising from the numerical instabilities in the HF molecular orbital Hessian can be avoided by the orbital-optimization. Hence, it appears that the orbital-optimized methods are the most natural choice for the study of the EKT. In this research, the EKT for the orbital-optimized methods, such as orbital-optimized second- and third-order MÃ¸llerâPlesset perturbation[U. Bozkaya, J. Chem. Phys.135, 224103 (2011)] and coupled-electron pair theories [OCEPA(0)] [U. Bozkaya and C. D. Sherrill, J. Chem. Phys.139, 054104 (2013)], are presented. The presented methods are applied to IPs of the second- and third-row atoms, and closed- and open-shell molecules. Performances of the orbital-optimized methods are compared with those of the counterpart standard methods. Especially, results of the OCEPA(0) method (with the aug-cc-pVTZ basis set) for the lowest IPs of the considered atoms and closed-shell molecules are substantially accurate, the corresponding mean absolute errors are 0.11 and 0.15 eV, respectively.},

In addition to standard applications to exchange-coupled atomic ions, the relevance of this work for the simple valence-bond model of conjugated pi -electron networks is mentioned.}

We show how mapping a critical ground state to a model of a rough interface can be used to identify the chiral symmetry algebra of the conformal field theory that describes its scaling limit. This is demonstrated in the case of the six-vertex model, the three-coloring model on the honeycomb lattice, and the four-coloring model on the square lattice. These models are critical and they are described in the continuum by conformal field theories whose symmetry algebras are the su(2)k=1, su(3)k=1, and the su(4)k=1 Kac-Moody algebra, respectively. Our approach is based on the Frenkel-Kac-Segal vertex operator construction of level-one Kac-Moody algebras."

volume={7 SP  -},
abstract={Despite its deceptive simplicity, few concepts have more fundamental implications than chirality, from the therapeutic activity of drugs to the fundamental forces of nature. In magnetic materials, chirality gives rise to unconventional phenomena such as the anomalous Hall effect and multiferroicity, taking an enhanced flavour in the so-called spin-liquid phases where magnetic disorder prevails. Kagome systems sit at the crossroad of these ideas. Motivated by the recent synthesis of rare-earth kagome materials and the progresses in optical-lattice experiments, we bring together an entire network of spin liquids with anisotropic and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions. This network revolves around the Ising antiferromagnet and ends on (ferromagnetic) chiral spin liquids with spontaneously broken time-reversal symmetry. As for the celebrated Heisenberg antiferromagnet, it now belongs to a triad of equivalently disordered phases. The present work provides a unifying theory of kagome spin liquids with time-reversal invariant nearest-neighbour Hamiltonians.},

abstract = "A spin-1/2 system on a honeycomb lattice is studied. The interactions between nearest neighbors are of XX, \{YY\} or \{ZZ\} type, depending on the direction of the link; different types of interactions may differ in strength. The model is solved exactly by a reduction to free fermions in a static Z 2 gauge field. A phase diagram in the parameter space is obtained. One of the phases has an energy gap and carries excitations that are Abelian anyons. The other phase is gapless, but acquires a gap in the presence of magnetic field. In the latter case excitations are non-Abelian anyons whose braiding rules coincide with those of conformal blocks for the Ising model. We also consider a general theory of free fermions with a gapped spectrum, which is characterized by a spectral Chern number ν. The Abelian and non-Abelian phases of the original model correspond to ν = 0 and ν = ±1, respectively. The anyonic properties of excitation depend on ν mod 16, whereas ν itself governs edge thermal transport. The paper also provides mathematical background on anyons as well as an elementary theory of Chern number for quasidiagonal matrices. "

  abstract={In this paper, we propose an exotic quantum paramagnetic state in two-dimensional antiferromagnets—the spontaneous trimer state—which is the direct product state of the trimers of spins. Each trimer is a singlet state formed by three neighboring spins with SU (3) symmetry. A frustrated spin-1 Heisenberg model in the kagome lattice is investigated. By analogy to the pseudo-potential approach in the fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE), we find that the trimer state provides a good description for the exact ground state of this model. Other interesting properties, such as the local excitations as well as magnetization plateaus have also been investigated.}

This insulating phase is proposed to be the long-sought ``resonating-valence-bond'' state or ``quantum spin liquid'' hypothesized in 1973. This insulating magnetic phase is favored by low spin, low dimensionality, and magnetic frustration. The preexisting magnetic singlet pairs of the insulating state become charged superconducting pairs when the insulator is doped sufficiently strongly. The mechanism for superconductivity is hence predominantly electronic and magnetic, although weak phonon interactions may favor the state. Many unusual properties are predicted, especially of the insulating state.},

abstract = { The density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) has become a powerful numerical method that can be applied to low-dimensional strongly correlated fermionic and bosonic systems. It allows for a very precise calculation of static, dynamic and thermodynamic properties. Its field of applicability has now extended beyond condensed matter, and is successfully used in quantum chemistry, statistical mechanics, quantum information theory, and nuclear and high-energy physics as well. In this article, we briefly review the main aspects of the method and present some of the most relevant applications so as to give an overview of the scope and possibilities of DMRG. We focus on the most important extensions of the method such as the calculation of dynamical properties, the application to classical systems, finite-temperature simulations, phonons and disorder, field theory, time-dependent properties and the ab initio calculation of electronic states in molecules. The recent quantum information interpretation, the development of highly accurate time-dependent algorithms and the possibility of using the DMRG as the impurity-solver of the dynamical mean field method (DMFT) give new insights into its present and potential uses. We review the numerous very recent applications of these techniques where the DMRG has shown to be one of the most reliable and versatile methods in modern computational physics. }

Reviewing past applications of DMRG in 2D demonstrates its success in treating a wide variety of problems, although it remains underutilized in this context. We present techniques for performing cutting-edge 2D DMRG studies including methods for ensuring convergence, extrapolating finite-size data, and extracting gaps and excited states. Finally, we consider a selection of recently developed 2D tensor network methods and compare the performance of one of these to 2D DMRG. }

  abstract={In this paper we present several examples of order due to disorder phenomena and mainly focus on the Heisenberg antiferromagnet with nearest neighbour interactions on the Husimi cactus, a system which locally has the same topology as the Kagomé lattice. This system has a huge classical degeneracy corresponding to an extensive number of degrees of freedom. We show that unlike thermal fluctuations, quantum fluctuations partially lift this degeneracy and favour a discrete subset of classical ground states. In order to clarify the origin of these effects, we have set up a general semiclassical analysis of the order from disorder phenomenon and clearly identified the differences between classical and quantum fluctuations. This semiclassical approach also enables us to classify various situations where a selection mechanism still occurs. Moreover, once a discrete set of ground states has been preselected, our analysis suggests that tunelling processes within this set should be the dominant effect underlying the strange low-energy spectrum of Kagomé-like lattices.}

  abstract={We have studied the failure of 'fluctuation-selection' in a ground state manifold associated with an extensive entropy. The recursive structure of the Husimi cactus permits exact calculation, and thus avoids problems associated with non-perturbative fluctuations. The structure of the barriers separating the ground states can be determined; in all the cases we have examined, we find that the system prefers to remain a spin liquid rather than to 'localize' in an ordered state that breaks the degeneracy of the manifold.}

  journal={New Journal of Physics},
  volume={12},
  number={7},
  pages={075027},
  year={2010},
  abstract={A useful concept for finding numerically the dominant correlations of a given ground state in an interacting quantum lattice system in an unbiased way is the correlation density matrix (CDM). For two disjoint, separated clusters, it is defined to be the density matrix of their union minus the direct product of their individual density matrices and contains all the correlations between the two clusters. We show how to extract from the CDM a survey of the relative strengths of the system's correlations in different symmetry sectors and the nature of their decay with distance (power law or exponential), as well as detailed information on the operators carrying long-range correlations and the spatial dependence of their correlation functions. To achieve this goal, we introduce a new method of analysing the CDM, termed the dominant operator basis (DOB) method, which identifies in an unbiased fashion a small set of operators for each cluster that serve as a basis for the dominant correlations of the system. We illustrate this method by analysing the CDM for a spinless extended Hubbard model that features a competition between charge density correlations and pairing correlations, and show that the DOB method successfully identifies their relative strengths and dominant correlators. To calculate the ground state of this model, we use the density matrix renormalization group, formulated in terms of a variational matrix product state (MPS) approach within which subsequent determination of the CDM is very straightforward. In an extended appendix, we give a detailed tutorial introduction to our variational MPS approach for ground state calculations for one-dimensional quantum chain models. We present in detail how MPSs overcome the problem of large Hilbert space dimensions in these models and describe all the techniques needed for handling them in practice.}
