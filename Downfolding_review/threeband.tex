\section{Representative Examples}
Given the theoretical framework for downfolding a many orbital (or many-electron) problem to a 
few orbital (or few-electron) problem, we now discuss examples which elucidate the DMD method. 
The examples are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item Section~\ref{subsection:3band}: Three-band Hubbard $\rightarrow$ one-band Hubbard at half filling. Demonstrates finding a basis set for the second quantized operators and uses a set of eigenstates directly sampled from the low-energy space to find a one-band model.
\item Section~\ref{subsection:1dhydrogen}: Hydrogen chain $\rightarrow$ one-band Hubbard model at half filling. Demonstrates basis sets for {\it ab initio} systems and the possibility to use this technique to determine the quality of a model to a given physical situation.
\item Section~\ref{subsection:graphene}: Graphene $\rightarrow$ one-band Hubbard model with and without $\sigma$ electrons. Demonstrates using the downfolding procedure to examine the effects of screening due to core electrons. 
\item Section~\ref{subsection:fese}: FeSe molecule $\rightarrow$ $3d,4p,4s$ system. Demonstrates the use of matching pursuit to assess the importance of terms in an effective model and to select compact effective models.
\end{itemize}

In all examples we will highlight the important ingredients associated with DMD. 
First and foremost is the choice of low energy space or energy window i.e. how our database of wave functions was generated. 
Associated with this is the choice of the one body space in terms of which the effective Hamiltonian is expressed. 
Finally, we discuss aspects of the functional forms or parameterizations that are expected to describe our physical problem. 
An important effective Hamiltonian that enters three out of our four representative examples is the single band Hubbard model:
\begin{equation}
	H = E_0 -t \;\sum_{\langle i,j \rangle, \eta} \tilde{d}_{i,\eta}^{\dagger} \tilde{d}_{j,\eta} + U \;\sum_{i} \tilde{n}^{i}_{\uparrow} \tilde{n}^{i}_{\downarrow}\,,
\label{eq:oneband}
\end{equation}
where $t$ and $U$ are downfolded (renormalized) parameters, $\eta$ is a spin index, 
$\tilde{d}_{i,\eta}$ is the effective one-particle operator associated with spatial orbital (or site) $i$ 
and $n_{i,\eta}=\tilde{d}_{i,\eta}^{\dagger} \tilde{d}_{i,\eta}$ is the corresponding number operator.
$\langle i,j \rangle$ is used to denote nearest neighbor pairs.
We will sometimes drop the constant energy shift $E_0$ when we write equations like Eq.~\eqref{eq:oneband}.

\subsection{Three-band Hubbard model to one-band Hubbard model at half filling}
\label{subsection:3band} 
Our first example is motivated by the high $T_c$ superconducting cuprates~\cite{Bednorz1986} that 
have parent Mott insulators with rich phase diagrams on electron or hole doping~\cite{Dagotto_RevModPhys, LeeWen_RevModPhys}. 
Many works have been devoted to their model Hamiltonians and corresponding parameter 
values~\cite{tJSpalek, Pavirini, Emery, ZhangRice, Hybertsen_PRB1989, Hybertsen_PRB1990, Kent_Hubbard}. 
A minimal model involving both the copper and oxygen degrees of freedom 
is the three-orbital or three-band Hubbard model, 
\begin{eqnarray}
H &=&    \epsilon_p \sum_{j\in p,\eta} n_{j,\eta} + \epsilon_{d} \sum_{i \in d,\eta}  n_{i,\eta} 
        + t_{pd} \sum_{\langle i\in d ,j \in p \rangle, \eta} \text{sgn}(p_i,d_j) \Big( c_{i,\eta}^{\dagger} c_{j,\eta} + \text{h.c.} \Big) \nonumber \\
          & &   + U_p \sum_{j\in p} n_{j,\uparrow} n_{j,\downarrow} + U_d \sum_{i\in d} n_{i,\uparrow} n_{i,\downarrow} + V_{pd} \sum_{\langle i \in p ,j \in d \rangle} n_j n_i\,,
\end{eqnarray}
where $d_i,p_j$ refer to the  $d_{x^2 - y^2}$ orbitals of copper at site $i$ and $p_x$ or $p_y$ 
oxygen at site $j$, respectively. 
$\text{sgn}(p_i,d_j)$ is the sign of the hopping $t_{pd}$ 
between nearest neighbors, shown schematically in Figure~\ref{fig:threeband}. 
$\epsilon_d$ and $\epsilon_p$ are orbital energies, $U_d$ and $U_p$ are strengths of onsite Hubbard interactions,  
and $V_{pd}$ is the strength of the density-density interactions between a neighboring $p$ and $d$ orbital. 
To simplify we consider only the case where $\epsilon_p$, $U_d$ and $t_{pd}$ are non zero; $t_{pd}$ is chosen throughout this section to be the typical value of $1.3$ eV to give the reader a sense of overall energy scales. 
Since we work with fixed number of particles we set our reference zero energy to be $\epsilon_d = 0$, thus the charge transfer energy $\Delta \equiv \epsilon_p - \epsilon_d$ equals $\epsilon_p$ in our notation. 
We work in the hole notation; half filling corresponds to two spin-up and two spin-down holes on the $2\times2$ cell.

{Schematic for downfolding the three-band Hubbard model on the $2\times2$ cell 
to the one-band Hubbard model. The oxygen orbitals are eliminated to give ``dressed" $d$-like orbitals of the one-band model, 
with modified hopping and interaction parameters. The relationship between the $\tilde{d}$ and the copper and oxygen orbitals is 
encoded by a linear transformation which is parameterized by $\alpha_1$, $\alpha_2$, $\alpha_3$, $\alpha_4$ and $F$ (see Appendix for more details).}
\label{fig:threeband} 
\end{figure}

It is our objective to determine what one-band Hubbard model~[Eq.~\eqref{eq:oneband}]
``best" describes the three-band data. The effective \textit{d-like} orbitals $\tilde{d}_{i,\eta}$, 
that enter the low energy description are mixtures of copper and oxygen orbitals; this optimal transformation also remains an unknown. 
Thus the model determination involves two aspects (1) what are the composite objects that give a 
compact description of the low energy physics? and (2) given this choice what are the effective interactions between them? 
(A similar problem was posed and solved by one of us in the context of spin systems~\cite{Changlani_percolation}.)
In addition, the best effective Hamiltonian description depends on the energy scale of interest. 
All these issues will be addressed in the remainder of the section. 

We begin by encoding the relationship between the bare and effective operators as a linear transformation ${\bf T}$, 
\begin{equation}
	\tilde{d}_{i,\eta} = \sum_{j} T_{ij} c_{j,\eta}
\label{eq:dc}
\end{equation}
where $c_{j,\eta}$ is the hole (destruction) operator and refers to either the bare $d$ or $p$ orbitals. 
Further generalizations of this relationship (for example, including higher body terms) are also possible, but have not been considered here. 
For the $2\times2$ unit cell, {\bf T} is a $4 \times 12 $ matrix, which we parameterize by 
four distinct parameters. These correspond to mixing of a copper orbital 
with nearest neighbor oxygens ($\alpha_1$), nearest neighbor coppers ($\alpha_2$), next-nearest neighbor oxygens ($\alpha_3$) 
and next-nearest neighbor coppers ($\alpha_4$) as shown schematically in Figure~\ref{fig:threeband}. 
The explicit form of ${\bf T}$ after accounting for the symmetries of the 
lattice has been written out in the Appendix. These parameters are optimized to minimize a certain cost function, 
which will be explained shortly. 

All RDMs in the three-band and one-band descriptions are also related via ${\bf T}$; 
the ones that we focus on are evaluated in eigenstate $s$ and are given by,
\begin{subequations}
\begin{eqnarray}
	\langle {\tilde{d}_{i,\eta}}^{\dagger} \tilde{d}_{j,\eta} \rangle_{s} &=& \sum_{mn} T^{*}_{im} \langle {c_{m,\eta}}^{\dagger} c_{n,\eta} \rangle_{s} T_{jn} \label{eq:dmstransformations1} \,,\\
	\langle \tilde{n}_{i,\uparrow} \tilde{n}_{i,\downarrow} \rangle_{s} &=& \sum_{jkmn} T^{*}_{ij} T^{*}_{im} \langle {c_{j,\uparrow}}^{\dagger} {c_{m,\downarrow}}^{\dagger} c_{n,\downarrow} c_{k,\uparrow} \rangle_{s} T_{in} T_{ik}\,.
\label{eq:dmstransformations2}
\end{eqnarray}
\end{subequations}
We optimize ${\bf T}$ by demanding two conditions be satisfied, (1) the effective orbitals ($\tilde{d}_{i,\eta}$) 
are orthogonal to each other i.e. $\Big({\bf T} {\bf T}^{\dagger}\Big)_{mn} = \delta_{mn}$
and (2) the sum of all diagonal entries (trace) of the 1-RDM of the effective orbitals for all low energy eigenstates 
equals the number of electrons of a given spin i.e. $\sum_{i} \sum_{\eta} \langle {\tilde{d}_{i,\eta}}^{\dagger} \tilde{d}_{i,\eta} \rangle_{s} = N_{\eta}$. 
These conditions are enforced by minimizing a cost function,
\begin{equation}
C = \sum_{s} \sum_{\eta} \Big( \sum_{i} \langle \tilde{d}_{i,\eta}^{\dagger} \tilde{d}_{i,\eta} \rangle_{s} - N_{\eta} \Big)^{2} + \sum_{mn} ( \Big({\bf T} {\bf T}^{\dagger}\Big)_{mn} -\delta_{mn})^{2}\,.
\label{eq:C}
\end{equation} 
For the $2\times2$ cell, $N_{\uparrow}=N_{\downarrow}=2$ and $i=1,2,3,4$. 
%a 12 orbital problem is downfolded to a 4 orbital one. 
The number of states $s$ was varied from three to six, depending on the energy window of interest.  

Figure~\ref{fig:varyUdep} shows regimes of the three-band model where 
the lowest six eigenstates are separated from the higher energy manifold; the 
fourth and fifth eigenstates are degenerate. 
In the large $U_d$ limit, charge fluctuations are suppressed and these six 
states correspond to the Hilbert space of $4 \choose 2$ states of the effective spin model in its $S_z=0$ sector.
These states have primarily \textit{d-like} character, an aspect we will verify in this section. 
The eigenstates outside of this manifold involve \textit{p-like} excitations which the one-band model is not designed 
to capture. 

%\lucas{what insight does knowing these alphas give? If it's how much d and p character I don't think anyone will know what they mean; I certainly don't. I think most of this paragraph can be supplementary or appendix.}. 
%{Transferred most of it, gave a compact example and combined with DMD para}
We chose the lowest three eigenstates of the three-band model for minimizing 
the cost in Eq.~\eqref{eq:C}. The four dimensional space of parameters of ${\bf T}$ 
was scanned for this purpose. The corresponding trace and orthogonality conditions are simultaneously 
satisfied with only small deviations, confirming the validity of Eq.~\eqref{eq:dc}. 
Importantly, the 1-RDM elements in the transformed basis corresponding to nearest neighbors $\langle \tilde{d}_1^{\dagger} \tilde{d}_2 \rangle_s$ 
already provide estimates for $U/t$ of the effective model. Since the exact knowledge of the corresponding eigenstates of 
the one-band Hubbard model is available for arbitrary $U/t$ by exact diagonalization, we directly look up the $U/t$ with 
the same 1-RDM value. These estimates complement the one obtained by DMD which was carried out 
with the same three low-energy eigenstates, using their energies and 
the computed values of $\langle \tilde{d}_1^{\dagger} \tilde{d}_2 \rangle_s$ 
and $\langle \tilde{n}_{i,\uparrow} \tilde{n}_{i,\downarrow} \rangle_{s}$ from Eqs.~\eqref{eq:dmstransformations1} 
and~\eqref{eq:dmstransformations2}~\footnote{We also mimicked the situation characteristic of \textit{ab initio} 
examples where no eigenstates are generally available. Several non eigenstates were generated as random linear combinations of 
the lowest three eigenstates and input into the DMD procedure, with 
similar outcomes.}. A representative example of our results for $U_{d}/t_{pd}=8$ and $\Delta/t_{pd}=3$ 
has been discussed in the Appendix. 
%the comparisons with eigenstates yielded 
%$(U/t)_1 \approx 14.1 $, $(U/t)_2 \approx 13.2 $, $(U/t)_3 \approx 12.7 $ and the DMD results were 
%$U/t = 13.45 $ and $t = 0.3025 $ eV.

%For our test example, we find $U/t = 13.45 $ and $t = 0.3025 $ eV. There is no error bar since there

%are three entries in the DMD procedure. 
%\HJC{Removed line about estimates, I am avoiding mention of "state matching" totally now}

\end{figure}

Some trends in the one-band description are explored in Figure~\ref{fig:varyUdep} 
by monitoring the downfolded parameters as a function of varying $\Delta/t_{pd}$ and $U_d/t_{pd}$. 
For example, when $U_d/t_{pd}=8$ is fixed and $\Delta/t_{pd}$ is increased, we find that 
the effective hopping $t$ decreases and $U/t$ increases. This is physically reasonable since an increasing difference in the 
single particle energies of the copper and oxygen orbitals makes it energetically unfavorable for holes 
to hop between the two orbitals. When $\Delta/t_{pd}=3$ is fixed and $U_d/t_{pd}$ is increased, $U/t$ increases. 
As one mechanism of avoiding the large $U_d$, the copper orbitals are forced to hybridize more with the oxygen ones; 
on the other hand, hole delocalization is suppressed in a bid to maintain mostly one hole per $\tilde{d}$ due to the larger 
$U/t$. The net result of these effects is that the $t$ also increases.%, albeit only marginally; a trend also observed in $\alpha_1$.

%We now perform checks on the accuracy of the downfolded model. 
An important check for the one-band model is its ability to reproduce the low energy gaps of the three-band model; these have been compared in Figure~\ref{fig:energyfit}. 
For the case of $\Delta/t_{pd}=3$, we observe that for all $U_d/t_{pd}$ the lowest three eigenstates were reproduced well. 
This model also reproduces the states outside of the DMD energy window, although with slightly larger errors. 
Similar trends are seen for the case of $\Delta/t_{pd}=5$, 
with the noticeable difference being that the energy error of the highest state has reduced. 
This also reflects that the parameters obtained from DMD are, in general, dependent on the energy window of interest, a 
point which we will highlight shortly by investigating it systematically.

%A promise of downfolding is to enable one to reduce the size of the effective Hilbert space; allowing 
A promise of downfolding is the reduction of the size of the effective Hilbert space; allowing 
simulations of bigger unit cells to be carried out. To show that this actually works well in practice for the three-band case, 
we consider the $2\sqrt{2} \times 2 \sqrt{2}$ square unit cell, comprising of 8 copper and 16 oxygen orbitals. 
For representative test cases, we performed exact diagonalization calculations at half filling; 
the Hilbert space comprises of 112,911,876 basis states. Roughly 200 Lanczos iterations were carried out, 
enabling convergence of the lowest four energies. We compared the lowest gaps with the 
corresponding calculation on the single band model on the same square geometry, with a Hilbert space size of only 4900, 
using the downfolded parameters obtained from the smaller $2 \times 2$ cell. 

Our results are summarized in Fig.~\ref{fig:predictivity}. In all cases, 
the agreement between the three-band and one-band models is remarkably good. The lowest energy gap error 
is within $0.0004$ eV (1\% relative error). 
The largest error in the third gap is of the order of $0.005$ eV (3\% relative error).
These results indicate the reliability of the downfolding procedure 
and highlight its predictive power.

Until this point, all our results focused on using only the lowest three eigenstates. We now explore 
the effect of increasing the energy window, by including higher eigenstates, using our 
test example of $U_d/t_{pd}=8$ and $\Delta/t_{pd}=3$. To do so, we now use 
all six low energy eigenstates for optimizing the cost function in Eq.~\eqref{eq:C}. We 
find similar (but not exactly the same) values of $\alpha_i$ compared to 
the case when only the three lowest states were used. The fact that a low cost solution can be attained 
confirms our expectation that the entire low energy space of six states is consistently 
described by a set of $\tilde{d}_i$ operators.

\label{fig:windows} 
\end{figure}	

However, as Figure~\ref{fig:windows}(A) shows, the estimates of $U/t$ and $t$ depend on how many eigenstates 
are used in the DMD procedure. This is because the DMD aims to provide the one-band description 
that best describes \textit{all} states in a given window. If the model is not perfect within a given energy window, 
an energy dependent model is expected, consistent with the renormalization group perspective. For our test example, 
increasing the number of eigenstates from three to six changed $U/t$ from $13.8$ to $9.44$ and $t$ from $0.3045$ to $0.2750$ eV.
\footnote{When three states were used for optimizing the orbitals and for the DMD, we found $U/t\approx 13.45$ and $t=0.3025$ eV. 
This is because $\tilde{d}$ are slightly different in the two cases.} 
The features associated with the energy dependence are further confirmed in Figure~\ref{fig:windows}(B). 
When only three states are used, the one-band (nearest neighbor) Hubbard model is insufficient for \textit{accurately}
describing states outside the window. When all six states are used, the DMD tries to minimize the error of the 
largest energy gap at the cost of errors in the smaller energy gaps. 
One could of course choose a different parameterization, say with additional next nearest neighbor $t'$, for which is 
may be possible to reduce this energy dependence significantly and thus have a model that describes the smaller 
and larger energy scales equally well.
