It is demonstrated via a simple group-theoretic argument that the ground states to many of these Hamiltonians are Kekule states, involving singlet spin-pairing between nearest-neighbour pairs of sites. A number of examples are given and previous related work is indicated. In addition to standard applications to exchange-coupled atomic ions, the relevance of this work for the simple valence-bond model of conjugated pi -electron networks is mentioned.}

We show how mapping a critical ground state to a model of a rough interface can be used to identify the chiral symmetry algebra of the conformal field theory that describes its scaling limit. This is demonstrated in the case of the six-vertex model, the three-coloring model on the honeycomb lattice, and the four-coloring model on the square lattice. These models are critical and they are described in the continuum by conformal field theories whose symmetry algebras are the su(2)k=1, su(3)k=1, and the su(4)k=1 Kac-Moody algebra, respectively. Our approach is based on the Frenkel-Kac-Segal vertex operator construction of level-one Kac-Moody algebras."

abstract={Despite its deceptive simplicity, few concepts have more fundamental implications than chirality, from the therapeutic activity of drugs to the fundamental forces of nature. In magnetic materials, chirality gives rise to unconventional phenomena such as the anomalous Hall effect and multiferroicity, taking an enhanced flavour in the so-called spin-liquid phases where magnetic disorder prevails. Kagome systems sit at the crossroad of these ideas. Motivated by the recent synthesis of rare-earth kagome materials and the progresses in optical-lattice experiments, we bring together an entire network of spin liquids with anisotropic and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions. This network revolves around the Ising antiferromagnet and ends on (ferromagnetic) chiral spin liquids with spontaneously broken time-reversal symmetry. As for the celebrated Heisenberg antiferromagnet, it now belongs to a triad of equivalently disordered phases. The present work provides a unifying theory of kagome spin liquids with time-reversal invariant nearest-neighbour Hamiltonians.},

abstract = "A spin-1/2 system on a honeycomb lattice is studied. The interactions between nearest neighbors are of XX, \{YY\} or \{ZZ\} type, depending on the direction of the link; different types of interactions may differ in strength. The model is solved exactly by a reduction to free fermions in a static Z 2 gauge field. A phase diagram in the parameter space is obtained. One of the phases has an energy gap and carries excitations that are Abelian anyons. The other phase is gapless, but acquires a gap in the presence of magnetic field. In the latter case excitations are non-Abelian anyons whose braiding rules coincide with those of conformal blocks for the Ising model. We also consider a general theory of free fermions with a gapped spectrum, which is characterized by a spectral Chern number ν. The Abelian and non-Abelian phases of the original model correspond to ν = 0 and ν = ±1, respectively. The anyonic properties of excitation depend on ν mod 16, whereas ν itself governs edge thermal transport. The paper also provides mathematical background on anyons as well as an elementary theory of Chern number for quasidiagonal matrices. "

  abstract={In this paper, we propose an exotic quantum paramagnetic state in two-dimensional antiferromagnets—the spontaneous trimer state—which is the direct product state of the trimers of spins. Each trimer is a singlet state formed by three neighboring spins with SU (3) symmetry. A frustrated spin-1 Heisenberg model in the kagome lattice is investigated. By analogy to the pseudo-potential approach in the fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE), we find that the trimer state provides a good description for the exact ground state of this model. Other interesting properties, such as the local excitations as well as magnetization plateaus have also been investigated.}

     abstract = {The oxide superconductors, particularly those recently discovered that are based on La$_{2}$CuO$_{4}$, have a set of peculiarities that suggest a common, unique mechanism: they tend in every case to occur near a metal-insulator transition into an odd-electron insulator with peculiar magnetic properties. This insulating phase is proposed to be the long-sought ``resonating-valence-bond'' state or ``quantum spin liquid'' hypothesized in 1973. This insulating magnetic phase is favored by low spin, low dimensionality, and magnetic frustration. The preexisting magnetic singlet pairs of the insulating state become charged superconducting pairs when the insulator is doped sufficiently strongly. The mechanism for superconductivity is hence predominantly electronic and magnetic, although weak phonon interactions may favor the state. Many unusual properties are predicted, especially of the insulating state.},

abstract = { The density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) has become a powerful numerical method that can be applied to low-dimensional strongly correlated fermionic and bosonic systems. It allows for a very precise calculation of static, dynamic and thermodynamic properties. Its field of applicability has now extended beyond condensed matter, and is successfully used in quantum chemistry, statistical mechanics, quantum information theory, and nuclear and high-energy physics as well. In this article, we briefly review the main aspects of the method and present some of the most relevant applications so as to give an overview of the scope and possibilities of DMRG. We focus on the most important extensions of the method such as the calculation of dynamical properties, the application to classical systems, finite-temperature simulations, phonons and disorder, field theory, time-dependent properties and the ab initio calculation of electronic states in molecules. The recent quantum information interpretation, the development of highly accurate time-dependent algorithms and the possibility of using the DMRG as the impurity-solver of the dynamical mean field method (DMFT) give new insights into its present and potential uses. We review the numerous very recent applications of these techniques where the DMRG has shown to be one of the most reliable and versatile methods in modern computational physics. }

Reviewing past applications of DMRG in 2D demonstrates its success in treating a wide variety of problems, although it remains underutilized in this context. We present techniques for performing cutting-edge 2D DMRG studies including methods for ensuring convergence, extrapolating finite-size data, and extracting gaps and excited states. Finally, we consider a selection of recently developed 2D tensor network methods and compare the performance of one of these to 2D DMRG. }

  abstract={In this paper we present several examples of order due to disorder phenomena and mainly focus on the Heisenberg antiferromagnet with nearest neighbour interactions on the Husimi cactus, a system which locally has the same topology as the Kagomé lattice. This system has a huge classical degeneracy corresponding to an extensive number of degrees of freedom. We show that unlike thermal fluctuations, quantum fluctuations partially lift this degeneracy and favour a discrete subset of classical ground states. In order to clarify the origin of these effects, we have set up a general semiclassical analysis of the order from disorder phenomenon and clearly identified the differences between classical and quantum fluctuations. This semiclassical approach also enables us to classify various situations where a selection mechanism still occurs. Moreover, once a discrete set of ground states has been preselected, our analysis suggests that tunelling processes within this set should be the dominant effect underlying the strange low-energy spectrum of Kagomé-like lattices.}

Our numerical estimates are in good agreement with available exact results and comparable, for large system sizes, to those computed via the best alternative numerical approaches, or by means of variational schemes based on specific (i.e. incorporating problem-dependent terms) trial wave functions (WFs). The extrapolation to the thermodynamic limit of our results for lattices comprising up to N =324 spins yields an upper bound of the GS energy per site (in units of the exchange coupling) of − 0.5458(2) [−0.4074(1) for the XX model], while the estimated infinite-lattice order parameter is 0.3178(5) (i.e. ~64% of the classical value).}

  abstract={We have studied the failure of 'fluctuation-selection' in a ground state manifold associated with an extensive entropy. The recursive structure of the Husimi cactus permits exact calculation, and thus avoids problems associated with non-perturbative fluctuations. The structure of the barriers separating the ground states can be determined; in all the cases we have examined, we find that the system prefers to remain a spin liquid rather than to 'localize' in an ordered state that breaks the degeneracy of the manifold.}

  abstract={A useful concept for finding numerically the dominant correlations of a given ground state in an interacting quantum lattice system in an unbiased way is the correlation density matrix (CDM). For two disjoint, separated clusters, it is defined to be the density matrix of their union minus the direct product of their individual density matrices and contains all the correlations between the two clusters. We show how to extract from the CDM a survey of the relative strengths of the system's correlations in different symmetry sectors and the nature of their decay with distance (power law or exponential), as well as detailed information on the operators carrying long-range correlations and the spatial dependence of their correlation functions. To achieve this goal, we introduce a new method of analysing the CDM, termed the dominant operator basis (DOB) method, which identifies in an unbiased fashion a small set of operators for each cluster that serve as a basis for the dominant correlations of the system. We illustrate this method by analysing the CDM for a spinless extended Hubbard model that features a competition between charge density correlations and pairing correlations, and show that the DOB method successfully identifies their relative strengths and dominant correlators. To calculate the ground state of this model, we use the density matrix renormalization group, formulated in terms of a variational matrix product state (MPS) approach within which subsequent determination of the CDM is very straightforward. In an extended appendix, we give a detailed tutorial introduction to our variational MPS approach for ground state calculations for one-dimensional quantum chain models. We present in detail how MPSs overcome the problem of large Hilbert space dimensions in these models and describe all the techniques needed for handling them in practice.}
